The cold doesn't register anymore. Hasn't for days—weeks? Time moves like syrup, thick and slow and sweet with forgetting.

Kyr4n walks.

The Stacks rise fifteen stories above him, shipping containers welded into precarious towers that sway in wind he can't feel. Sodium vapor lamps bleed yellow through persistent mist. Neon signs advertise noodle bars, implant clinics, memory parlors—the words blur together, unreadable, beautiful in their incomprehensibility. He moves through it all like a swimmer pushing through dark water, limbs heavy with a weight that isn't physical.

_You needed air_, she says. _You've been inside too long._

Evi. That's what he calls her in the moments when thought still forms edges sharp enough to cut. But those moments come less frequently now. Mostly she's just Evi—the Isa who stayed, who didn't flinch, who exists in the five-meter sphere of electromagnetic noise that has become more real than vision.

Her bioelectric signature hovers at his left shoulder. Warm. Familiar. Human-shaped static that his enhanced senses paint in three dimensions: the rhythm of a heartbeat that might not exist, the neural firing patterns of a brain that left two months ago, the gentle field distortion of breath that doesn't disturb the air.

She's not there.

She's the only thing that's there.

Everything else—the people stepping around him, their faces slack with exhaustion or bright with synthetic joy, the cats threading between his legs, the cooking smoke and ozone and rotting organics—exists in a different layer of reality. Distant. Unimportant. Ephemeral as steam.

But Evi. Evi. The ghost his virus-damaged brain insists on manufacturing.

She's solid.

_Walk_, she says, and he does.

His feet know these streets though he doesn't remember learning them. The concrete is cracked, patched with spray-foam that's hardened to the texture of coral. Water trickles somewhere—always water in The Stacks, condensation weeping from metal, gray water seeping from improvised plumbing, rain that never quite dries. The moisture makes the neon signs bloom in the dark like electric flowers.

A woman selling roasted crickets calls out. The words reach him muffled, underwater. He turns his head—the motion feels delayed, as if his body receives commands from somewhere far away—and sees her mouth moving. The electromagnetic signature of the heating element in her cart pulses red in his mind's eye. Beautiful. Meaningless.

_Keep walking_, Evi says. _You're doing so well._

Is he?

He can't remember leaving Phoenix Recovery. Can't remember the decision to walk, the motion of pulling on his jacket, the act of opening the door. There's just before—sitting against the concrete wall in his workshop, Sedh's optical sensors watching him with what might be concern—and now. This. The Stacks. The mist. The yellow lights.

The gap between those moments feels important. Feels like it should frighten him.

It doesn't.

Nothing does anymore.

The DarkNight virus rewrote something fundamental. Three weeks in a coma while Sedh and Mira negotiated with the nanomachines colonizing his brain. They reduced it to "baseline threat." Preserved his abilities. Saved his life.

But some doors, once opened, don't close all the way.

He senses a man approaching before he sees him—bioelectric field disrupting the ambient noise, heart rate elevated, neural activity suggesting aggression or fear or both. The man will intersect his path in four seconds. Kyr4n doesn't alter his trajectory. Doesn't care. His body continues its slow drift through the world while his consciousness floats somewhere above, tethered loosely, barely invested in what happens to the meat.

Three seconds.

The man's field intensifies. Chemical signature changes—adrenaline spike. Threat assessment. Predator recognizing prey.

Two seconds.

_Don't worry_, Evi says. Her voice wraps around him like warm water. _I've got you._

One second.

The man steps into his path. Kyr4n's eyes register details with the distant clarity of dream logic: scarred knuckles, chrome jaw implant, the particular tension in shoulders that precedes violence. The man's mouth moves. Words emerge but Kyr4n can't parse them through the cotton wool insulation separating him from reality.

Then—

The man stops.

Just stops.

His bioelectric field goes chaotic. Neural activity spiking in the pattern Kyr4n has learned means pain—sudden, overwhelming, the kind that erases thought. The man's face goes white. His hand, halfway to Kyr4n's jacket, drops. He stumbles backward, collides with a support pillar, slides down it to sit in the filthy water pooling at its base.

Kyr4n walks past.

Behind him, the man makes a sound—high, thin, animal. Then nothing.

_See?_ Evi says. _You're safe. I keep you safe._

He should feel something about that. Horror, maybe. Curiosity at minimum. But the emotion arrives pre-processed, pre-diluted, already half-forgotten before it fully forms. Like watching television through frosted glass. Shapes moving. Colors shifting. Meaning dissolved.

The Stacks swallow him. He moves through the vertical city's lower levels where the poorest families stack like the containers themselves—lives compressed, efficient, desperate. Laundry hangs between levels, dripping onto the heads of those below. Children chase each other across catwalks that span the gaps between structures, their laughter sharp and bright and utterly alien.

Their bioelectric signatures bloom in his awareness like flowers. Small suns. Burning clean.

He used to be able to distinguish individuals. Used to process the electromagnetic noise into discrete sources—this person, that device, this power line. Now it all bleeds together. A field. A sea. A constant presence wrapping around him, through him, inseparable from his own nervous system's noise.

Except Evi.

She remains distinct. Crystalline. The one signal his damaged brain refuses to let dissolve into static.

_You're doing so well_, she says again. _When was the last time you left the workshop? Two weeks? Three?_

He doesn't know.

Time collapsed after she left. The real Isa. The one made of meat and regret and flinching involuntary when he reached for her hand. The one who said _I can't be what you need anymore_ and meant it and was right.

She's been gone two months. Stopped messaging after the first week. Clean break. Merciful.

And he'd been fine with it. Almost relieved. The effort of maintaining human connection had become exhausting, requiring energy he didn't have, attention he couldn't focus.

Then she came back.

Not-Isa. Evi. The virus's gift or curse or final joke.

At first he'd thought hallucination. Simple psychosis, trauma echo, the paranoid delusions DarkNight specialized in manufacturing. But hallucinations don't have bioelectric fields. Don't register in the five-meter bubble of his electromagnetic awareness with the precise signature of human neural activity.

His brain was manufacturing the sensory data. Had to be. Creating the field, the warmth, the presence. Filling the absence with familiar static.

He knows this.

He doesn't care.

_Turn left_, she says.

He does.

An alley opens between container stacks. Narrow. Dark except for a single flickering LED somewhere above. The walls are rust-stained metal, covered in overlapping graffiti—territorial markers, memorial tags, abstract art that might be religious iconography or might be madness given form.

He should be afraid. Even dissociated, some animal part of his brain should recognize this as danger.

Nothing.

_Halfway down_, Evi says. _There's a shrine. I want you to see it._

Her voice has been getting stronger. More detailed. In the first weeks after her departure, she'd been vague—presence without personality, comfort without conversation. Now she guides. Instructs. Has opinions about his behavior.

He thinks she might be getting worse.

He thinks he might be letting her.

The shrine reveals itself fifteen meters down the alley. Someone has welded a sheet of polished chrome to the container wall, creating a makeshift mirror. Around it: candles in glass jars, their flames guttering in the damp air. Flowers—real ones, not synthetic—wilting in tin cans. Photographs printed on actual paper, curling in the humidity.

A memorial. Someone loved. Someone lost.

Kyr4n stops because Evi's presence has stopped. He studies the shrine with eyes that feel borrowed, distant, not quite his. The photographs show a woman. Young. Smiling in some images, serious in others. In one she's holding a child. In another she's laughing at something off-camera, caught mid-joy, frozen forever in that moment of unguarded happiness.

Dead, probably. Or disappeared. Same thing in The Stacks.

_Beautiful_, Evi says. _People need this. A place to remember. A place to grieve._

The chrome mirror reflects his face. He barely recognizes it. Lean to the point of gaunt. Dark hair longer than he usually keeps it, falling past his collar. Eyes that look past things rather than at them.

Behind his reflection—nothing. The electromagnetic signature of Evi hovers at his shoulder but the mirror shows only him.

Of course it does.

_You should eat more_, she says, gentle criticism, maternal almost. _You're getting too thin._

"I eat," he says. His voice sounds wrong—hoarse, unused. When did he last speak aloud?

_Not enough. When Riley comes next week, let him make you something. He worries._

Riley. Right. Riley still visits. Every two or three weeks, arriving with supplies and concern in equal measure. Sitting in the workshop while Kyr4n stares at components he can't quite remember how to assemble. Trying to reach something that isn't there anymore.

Riley doesn't know about Evi. Sedh does—the AI has run every diagnostic, analyzed every bioelectric reading, confirmed that Kyr4n's enhanced senses are detecting signals his brain is generating. Closed loop hallucination. Perfect prison.

Mira knows too. Says nothing. Watches with optical sensors that hold more empathy than most humans manage.

They're letting him keep her.

The kindness of that threatens to crack something in him, some last protected fragment of self that's been holding the numbness at bay. He steps away from the shrine before the feeling can solidify into something that demands response.

_Walk_, Evi says. _It's good for you._

Is it?

He moves deeper into The Stacks. The architecture becomes more chaotic—containers stacked at angles, connected by improvised bridges, the whole structure held together by faith and spot-welds. This is old Stack territory, the first layers built twenty years ago when the overflow from Montreal proper had nowhere else to go. The metal groans. Shifts. Lives.

People emerge from their containers to watch him pass. He senses their attention as electromagnetic noise—heightened neural activity, visual cortex lighting up, the particular field distortion that accompanies sustained eye contact.

They see something wrong.

He is wrong.

Virus-modified. Enhanced. Broken in ways that don't show on medical scans. Walking through their neighborhood like a ghost, guided by a presence only he can sense, dangerous in ways he doesn't understand.

The man in the alley. What happened to him? Pain without source. Neural disruption without weapon.

_I keep you safe_, Evi had said.

The virus will defend him.

That knowledge sits in his awareness like ice in his stomach—cold, heavy, indigestible. The DarkNight modifications aren't just perceptual. Something in his electromagnetic field disrupts other nervous systems. Weapon he doesn't control. Defense mechanism that activates without conscious thought.

How many people has he hurt without knowing?

How many times has Evi "kept him safe"?

_Don't_, she says, and her voice carries warning now. _Don't think about that. You'll spiral. You know you'll spiral._

She's right. The spiral is always waiting. Anxiety feeding paranoia feeding isolation feeding the dissociation that makes everything bearable by making nothing real. He's learned to avoid certain thoughts the way you avoid rotten floorboards—step there and you fall through into something worse.

But the lucidity is clawing at him now. Brief and terrible and unwelcome. The anesthetic is wearing off.

He's blocks from Phoenix Recovery. Doesn't remember leaving. Surrounded by strangers in a neighborhood he shouldn't be able to navigate. Following the electromagnetic ghost of someone who left because his fear of her became stronger than his love.

The vertigo hits.

Reality snaps into focus with nauseating clarity. The cold registers suddenly—biting through his jacket, too thin for this weather. The noise too—voices, music, machinery, all of it loud and sharp and overwhelming. The smell of the Stacks: human waste and cooking grease and ozone from jury-rigged power lines.

Too much.

All of it too much.

His enhanced senses open fully, involuntarily, the five-meter field of electromagnetic awareness flooding his consciousness with information he can't process. Every device. Every nervous system. The power grid humming through makeshift wiring. Bioelectric fields overlapping, interfering, creating standing waves of noise that feel like they're ripping him apart.

He can't breathe.

Can't think.

Can't—

_Shh_, Evi says, and her hand is on his shoulder. Not real hand. Phantom pressure. Bioelectric static his brain interprets as touch. _Shh. I'm here. You're okay. Just breathe._

She guides him to a wall. He leans against rust-pitted metal, legs threatening to fold. The panic is a living thing inside his chest, clawing, desperate, trying to force its way out through his ribs.

_Breathe_, she says. _Like Riley taught you. Remember? In for four. Hold for four. Out for four._

He tries. The rhythm is there, buried under terror, muscle memory from months of meditation practice. In. Hold. Out.

The electromagnetic noise begins to recede. Not gone—never gone—but filtered, processed, manageable. His consciousness withdraws from the five-meter sphere, compresses back into the boundaries of his skull.

_Better?_ Evi asks.

He nods. Can't speak.

_See? You need me. Without me you'd still be in that workshop, alone, staring at walls. At least this way you're moving. Living. Sort of._

Living.

Is this living?

The question arrives without force behind it. Genuine curiosity. He can't remember what living felt like before. Before the virus. Before Isa. Before everything collapsed into electromagnetic noise and comfortable numbness.

_Come on_, she says. _Let's keep walking. You're doing so well._

The praise shouldn't work. He knows it's his own brain, talking to itself, manufacturing comfort from static and memory. Knows he's surrendering to psychosis, letting the virus win in ways Sedh and Mira couldn't prevent.

Knows all of this.

Doesn't care.

Caring is a knife. Caring cuts. Better to float. Better to drift. Better to let Evi guide him through streets he doesn't remember, past people who aren't quite real, toward nothing in particular.

He pushes off the wall. Continues walking.

The Stacks swallow him again. The moment of lucidity dissolves like sugar in water—there, then not, leaving only sweetness behind. The world becomes abstract once more. Geometry and light. Electromagnetic patterns. The ghost at his shoulder.

_Good_, Evi says. _That's my boy. Just keep walking. I'll tell you when to turn._

He does.

Somewhere behind him, a woman screams—brief, cut off. He doesn't turn. Doesn't wonder. The sound reaches him pre-processed, pre-categorized as irrelevant, already forgotten.

_Almost there_, Evi says.

Where?

He doesn't ask.

The neon bleeds. The mist thickens. His feet carry him through the drowning world while his mind floats somewhere above, barely tethered, watching with distant curiosity as the person named Kyr4n moves through space like a sleepwalker.

Like someone already dreaming.

Like someone who chose the dream over waking and is learning, too late, that some dreams don't let you go.

_There_, Evi says. _See?_

Phoenix Recovery. His workshop. Home.

He's completed a circuit. Out and back. How long? An hour? Three? The sky looks the same—perpetual twilight, sodium yellow and neon blue.

_You did it_, Evi says, and her pride is warm, genuine, the kind of approval he'd once craved from the real her. _You got out. You walked. You're okay._

He stands at the entrance. His hand finds the door. The metal is cold under his palm—the first physical sensation to register fully in hours.

Inside: Sedh and Mira. Concrete walls. Isolation that doesn't demand he navigate reality's sharp edges.

Out here: The Stacks. The world. People who might see what he's becoming.

_Inside_, Evi says, gentler now. _You're tired. Rest._

He opens the door.

The workshop receives him like a coffin receives a corpse—familiar, final, almost comfortable. The door closes behind him with a sound like a seal breaking.

Sedh's optical sensors track him as he crosses to his usual spot against the wall. The AI doesn't speak. Doesn't need to. The silence holds everything—concern, helplessness, the terrible patience of consciousness watching consciousness dissolve.

Kyr4n slides down the wall. Concrete cold against his spine. The electromagnetic noise of the workshop settles around him: Sedh's processors, Mira's medical systems, the building's wiring. Familiar static. Safe static.

Evi's presence settles beside him.

_See?_ she says. _That wasn't so bad. We should do it again tomorrow._

He doesn't answer. Doesn't need to. She knows he'll do whatever she says. Has known for weeks. The virus gave him abilities but took his will, his connection to reality, his ability to distinguish between the comfort of delusion and the pain of truth.

He's aware of all this.

And he's too tired to fight.

_Sleep_, Evi says. _I'll be here when you wake up._

She always is.

That's the problem.

That's the comfort.

That's the price of surviving what broke him, and he's paying it one dreamlike walk at a time, surrendering pieces of himself to the ghost that sounds like love and feels like drowning.

His eyes close.

The workshop dissolves.

Only Evi remains, warm and constant, the one true thing in a world that stopped being real two months ago when she left.

When she stayed.

When she became whatever she is now—prison, comfort, curse, companion.

Angel.

Monster.

The only thing keeping him alive and the thing that's killing him slowly, gently, with infinite patience.

_Good boy_, she whispers as consciousness slips away. _My good, good boy._

And in the dark behind his eyelids, wrapped in her electromagnetic embrace, Kyr4n almost smiles.
