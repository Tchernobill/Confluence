The communal lounge was deserted at 0630. Zara paused in the doorway, scanning the space. Found him in the corner—back to wall, tablet in hand, coffee untouched.

Waiting for her.

Her stomach tightened. She'd spent the night replaying cracked tiles, his horror, her realization that she'd pushed him there deliberately. Hadn't slept. Doubted he had either, judging by the shadows under his eyes.

She crossed to the couch across from him and sat, maintaining careful distance.

"Morning," she said quietly.

"Morning." He set down the tablet. Neither reached for small talk.

Silence stretched between them, weighted with things unsaid. She studied her hands, remembering how they'd gripped his shoulders while she'd demanded he lose control. While she'd pushed past every limit he'd tried to maintain.

"I'm sorry," they both said simultaneously.

They stopped. Looked at each other. Something almost like a smile crossed his face, then faded.

"You first," he said.

"I pushed too hard." The words came easier than expected. "You tried to hold back. I felt it. And I pushed harder anyway. That was wrong."

He shook his head. "You didn't know what could happen. I did. I should have—" He stopped, jaw tight. "I should have stopped."

"But I didn't want you to." She met his eyes. "That's on me."

Another figure passed in the hallway—distant footsteps fading. They both waited until quiet returned.

"We can't do that again," he said finally. "The physical thing. It's too dangerous."

She'd expected this. Had come to the same conclusion herself during the long night. "I know."

"You're sure?" Something in his voice—hope? relief?—that she wasn't going to fight this.

"I'm sure." She paused. "But I need to know we're... ok. Professionally. That this doesn't change the working relationship."

"It doesn't." His voice carried certainty. "You're good at what you do. I trust you. That hasn't changed."

Some of the tension in her chest eased. "Good. Because I don't want to lose that."

"Neither do I."

They sat in comfortable silence for a moment. Crisis acknowledged. Boundaries established. Connection maintained. It should have been enough.

But the question still gnawed at her. The one she'd spent all night trying to answer.

"Can I ask you something?" she said quietly.

"Of course."

She hesitated, choosing words carefully. "Why did I want it? The danger. Pushing you past limits even when you tried to hold back." She looked up at him. "What's wrong with me?"

His expression softened. "Nothing's wrong with you, Zara. Stop telling yourself that."

"Then why do I seek out danger like that? Why do I need—" She stopped, frustrated by her inability to articulate it. "There's something in my past. Something that shaped me this way. I can feel it, but I can't see it. Can't understand it."

He was quiet, studying her face with that intense focus he sometimes showed.

"I need to know where it came from," she continued. "Why I'm wired like this. The refugee camps, maybe. Something from childhood. I don't know." She met his eyes. "But I need to understand."

"Self-examination takes time," he said carefully. "There aren't easy answers."

"I'm not looking for easy." She leaned forward slightly. "I'm looking for help. From someone who understands... complex psychology."

She could see him tense slightly. Saw him weighing something she couldn't follow.

"What you're asking for—" He stopped, started again. "Understanding trauma patterns, buried memories—that requires methods that are invasive. Uncomfortable. Risky."

"I know it won't be pleasant." She kept her voice steady. "But not knowing is worse. Repeating patterns I don't understand until..." She gestured vaguely at the space between them. Until tiles crack. Until someone gets hurt.

He was quiet for a long moment, and she could see internal war happening behind his eyes. The desire to help conflicting with something else. Fear? Uncertainty?

"It would take time," he said finally. "To... prepare. To make sure it's done safely."

Not refusal. Not quite agreement. Something in between.

"How long?" she asked.

"A few days. Maybe a week." He met her eyes. "I need to work some things out first. Figure out protocols. Make sure I can do this without causing damage."

Hope flickered in her chest. "So you're considering it?"

"I'm considering it." His voice carried caution. "No promises. But I'll think about it seriously."

It wasn't yes. But it wasn't no either. After last night's refusal, after trying and failing to find answers through physical means, this felt like progress.

"A few days," she agreed. "I can wait that long."

"Thank you."

They sat in silence for another moment. Something had shifted between them—not broken, not fixed, just... changed. Boundaries established. Trust maintained. Possibility opened.

She stood, shifting back to professional mode. "See you at the afternoon briefing?"

"1400. Conference room three."

"I'll be there." She turned to leave, then paused. "And Kyr4n? Thank you. For hearing me out."

He nodded, something complicated crossing his face. "I'll do what I can."

She left him there with his untouched coffee and his tablet, carrying the small hope that maybe, possibly, he'd find a way to help her understand.

Behind her, Kyr4n sat in the quiet lounge, already calculating what he'd need to do in the next few days. Not just preparing protocols or safety measures.

He needed better control. Tighter restraint over the abilities that had nearly hurt her. The nanobotic virus responded to his emotional state, to loss of control, to intensity that overrode conscious thought.

If he was going to go into her mind—and he suspected he would, despite every protective instinct screaming not to—he needed to be absolutely certain he could maintain control throughout. That the neural bridge wouldn't become something darker. That helping her understand wouldn't damage her in ways he couldn't predict or prevent.

A few days. Maybe a week.

Time to shore up defenses that had cracked last night along with those tiles.

Time to make sure he could give her what she needed without destroying her in the process.
