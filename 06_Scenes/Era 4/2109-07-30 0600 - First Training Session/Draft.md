The underground training facility sat three levels below street access, a converted maintenance bay that Marcus had repurposed during Rico's era and quietly upgraded since the takeover. Reinforced walls, proper ventilation, impact-absorbent flooring. The space smelled of industrial cleaner, old sweat, and the ozone tang of charging stations for augmented equipment.

Zara arrived at 0600 sharp, dressed in training gear—form-fitting black tactical pants, compression top, hair pulled back tight. She'd brought her own equipment: focus mitts, resistance bands, practice blades.

Kyr4n was already there, which surprised her. Sitting on a bench against the wall, wearing what looked like street clothes—dark pants, plain shirt. Reading something on a datapad. No proper training gear, no preparation, just... waiting.

Marcus stood near the entrance, arms crossed, expression carefully neutral.

"You're early," Zara said to Kyr4n.

He looked up. "Marcus said 0600. It's 0558."

"Training means you arrive early enough to be ready _by_ the scheduled time." She gestured at his outfit. "Did you bring proper gear?"

"No. Should I have?"

Zara closed her eyes briefly, summoning patience. "Yes. You should have. But we can work with this for now." She dropped her bag on a bench. "Strip off the shirt. I need to see how you move without obstruction."

Kyr4n complied without self-consciousness, pulling off his shirt to reveal a lean build—not muscular, exactly, but defined in the way of someone with low body fat. No obvious scarring. No augmentation ports. She ran her enhanced vision over him analytically: baseline human physiology, maybe slightly better muscle tone than expected for someone who apparently didn't train.

"Stand in the center," she directed. "Feet shoulder-width apart."

He moved to the indicated spot, stance exactly as casual as his walk through the market yesterday.

"No." Zara moved closer, circling him. "Weight's wrong. You're standing like you're waiting for a tram. In a defensive stance, your weight should be—" She demonstrated. "—balanced on the balls of your feet, ready to move in any direction. Try it."

Kyr4n shifted his weight. The adjustment was mechanically correct but somehow still wrong, like he was mimicking the form without understanding the purpose.

"Better," she said, though it wasn't really. "Now, basic awareness. In a hostile situation, you need to constantly scan your environment. Exits, threats, cover. Let's test your baseline. Close your eyes."

He did.

"I'm going to move around you. Tell me when you think I'm about to touch you."

Zara began circling, her enhanced movement silent on the training mat. She'd done this exercise hundreds of times with trainees—most couldn't track her position at all with eyes closed, relied entirely on sound, and she could move silently enough that they'd fail completely.

She approached from his right side, hand extending toward his shoulder—

"Now," Kyr4n said calmly. "Right side, approximately forty degrees, reaching for my shoulder."

Zara froze, hand two inches from contact. That was... lucky. Probably heard her breath or the slight displacement of air.

She withdrew, circled to his left, approached from behind, slower this time, controlling her breathing—

"Left rear, lower. Going for kidney strike position."

She stopped again, frowning. Her hand had been aimed exactly where he'd indicated.

Marcus made a small sound that might have been a suppressed cough.

Zara tried three more approaches—different angles, different speeds, even testing whether he was cheating by listening to her footfalls. Each time, he called out her position with unsettling accuracy. Not approximate. Exact.

"Okay," she said slowly. "You can open your eyes. How are you doing that?"

"Doing what?"

"Tracking my position with your eyes closed."

Kyr4n considered this. "I'm not sure. I can just... feel where you are."

"Feel?"

"Sense your location. The space around me." He paused, like he was trying to explain something he didn't fully understand himself. "Like knowing where the walls of a room are even in the dark. Spatial awareness."

Zara's tactical wetware flagged that as unusual but not impossible—some baseline humans developed exceptional proprioception and environmental awareness. Rare, but it happened.

"Interesting," she said neutrally. "That'll make some aspects of training easier. Now, let's work on basic defensive movement. I'm going to throw slow strikes—just demonstrating form. Don't try to block yet, just observe. Ready?"

"Ready."

Zara moved into range, throwing a textbook slow-motion jab toward his center mass, pulling it to stop six inches short—

Kyr4n's torso shifted. Minimal movement, just enough that her fist would have passed by his ribs instead of connecting.

She paused. "I said don't try to block. Just observe."

"I wasn't blocking. I was watching your fist."

"You moved."

"Did I?" He looked genuinely uncertain.

Zara frowned. "Stay still this time. I need you to see the full technique before you start trying to respond."

She threw another slow jab. Again, his body shifted—small weight redistribution that would have made her strike miss by an inch.

"You're doing it again," she said.

"Doing what?"

"Moving. Evading." She studied his face, looking for signs he was messing with her. Found only honest confusion.

"I'm trying to stay still," Kyr4n said. "Maybe my balance is off?"

Marcus coughed again, definitely suppressing something this time.

"Fine," Zara said, adjusting her approach. "Let's try combinations. I'll show you a basic defensive sequence—block high, block low, redirect. Watch first."

She demonstrated the form in slow motion, precise and controlled. Kyr4n watched with that analytical focus, like he was memorizing the sequence.

"Your turn," she said. "Slowly. I'll guide you through it."

She threw the first strike—a straight punch toward his head, slow enough that he should have had plenty of time to raise the proper block.

He raised his arm, but the form was completely wrong—elbow out instead of in, hand open instead of closed, wrist positioned incorrectly. Amateur hour.

But the block still worked. Her fist contacted his forearm exactly where it needed to for deflection, despite his terrible technique.

"No," Zara said. "The form's wrong. You need to—" She adjusted his arm position. "—like this. Tighter. More efficient. Try again."

Second attempt. His form was marginally better but still showed zero actual training. Except somehow the block still functioned perfectly, her strike glancing off his arm with the exact angle needed for proper deflection.

Third strike, low toward his ribs. He dropped his elbow to block, technique terrible, position perfect. Like his body knew where to be even though his brain clearly didn't know the proper form.

"Okay," Zara said, stepping back. "Have you trained before? At all?"

"No."

"You're sure? Maybe some basic self-defense classes you forgot about?"

"I'm sure. The only fighting I've done was survival necessity, not training."

"Huh." She studied him, running scenarios. His technique was abysmal—no muscle memory, no proper form, completely untrained. But his physical responses were... odd. Too precise for random luck. Too consistent for coincidence.

"Let's try faster," she decided. "Three-strike combination. You won't have time to think, so I'll see how your instincts respond. Ready?"

"Ready."

Zara stepped in, throwing a proper combination at quarter speed—still fast enough to test genuine reflexes. Jab, cross, hook.

Kyr4n's responses were a disaster of form. Arms flailing almost randomly, no proper technique, movements that should have left him wide open. But somehow each strike met resistance exactly where needed. His terrible blocks still functioned. His wild movements still created deflection angles.

It was like watching someone who'd never driven a car successfully navigate traffic—wrong inputs producing right outcomes through pure luck except it kept happening.

"Again," Zara said. "Faster this time."

She increased to half speed. Same result—terrible technique, perfect positioning. His body responded faster than his training should allow, finding the right spatial relationships through methods she couldn't identify.

"How are you doing that?" she asked, genuinely puzzled now.

"Doing what?"

"Your technique is awful. Seriously, some of the worst form I've seen. But you're still blocking effectively. It doesn't make sense."

Kyr4n looked at his hands, thoughtful. "I don't know the proper forms. I'm just... trying to prevent your fists from hitting me. Is that wrong?"

"No, it's—" Zara paused, recalibrating. "It's instinctive rather than trained. Your body knows where to be even if you don't know the proper technique. That's unusual but not impossible."

She pulled out the focus mitts, strapping them onto her hands. "Let's try offense. I'm going to call out combinations. Jab-cross. Hook-uppercut. Simple stuff. When I call it, you throw the punch at the mitt. Don't worry about power yet, just work on form and speed. Ready?"

"Ready."

"Jab."

Kyr4n threw a punch that made Zara wince. Terrible form—thumb positioned wrong, wrist loose, elbow flared out, weight transfer nonexistent. The kind of punch that would break his own hand if it connected with anything solid.

But it was _fast_. Unnaturally fast. The mitt snapped back against her palm with more force than his lean build should generate, and her enhanced reflexes barely registered the movement before impact.

"Stop," she said. "Where did that speed come from?"

"What speed?"

"That punch. It was fast. Too fast for someone with your build and training."

"Was it? I was trying to go slowly."

Zara's tactical wetware threw up a warning flag. Something was wrong with this picture. His technique said: untrained civilian, no power, no speed, no threat. But her palm was tingling from the impact force, and her enhanced vision had clocked his strike speed as abnormally quick.

"Do it again," she said. "Same punch. But this time, slower. Show me the movement in stages."

Kyr4n threw another jab, mechanically breaking it into segments. The form was still terrible, but she could see the muscle engagement now—lean muscles moving with unexpected efficiency, like his body was optimized for power transfer in ways that didn't match his apparent training.

"Okay," she said slowly. "Your form is shit, but you've got natural speed and some strength. We can work with that. Let's drill combinations. I'll call them out, you throw them. We'll work on form later. Right now I just want to see what you can do."

For the next twenty minutes, she ran him through basic combinations. Every punch showed the same pattern—terrible technique, surprising speed and power. He didn't know how to stand. Didn't know how to transfer weight. Didn't know how to protect his ribs or keep his chin down.

But he was fast. And somehow his spatial awareness compensated for his lack of training—he always knew exactly where she was, adjusted distance perfectly, found angles that shouldn't have been available to someone with his level of skill.

"Break," Zara called finally, pulling off the mitts. "Water. Five minutes."

Kyr4n wasn't even breathing hard, which annoyed her. She'd been drilling him at a pace that should have winded an untrained baseline human. Her own enhanced cardiovascular system barely registered the workout, but he should be struggling.

He took a water bottle from the bench, drinking with that same mechanical calm.

Marcus approached, expression carefully neutral. "How's it going?"

"Weird," Zara said quietly. "His technique is terrible. Like, genuinely awful. But his physical responses are way better than they should be. Fast reflexes, good power, that spatial awareness thing. It's like his body knows what to do even though his brain clearly doesn't have the training."

"Interesting," Marcus said, in a tone that suggested he'd expected exactly this.

"You knew," Zara accused.

"I knew he was unusual. I wanted you to discover it yourself."

"What is he? Some kind of genetic optimization case? Black market gene therapy?"

"Something like that," Marcus said vaguely. "The important thing is, can you work with it?"

Zara looked at Kyr4n, who was studying his own hands with analytical interest, like he was trying to solve a puzzle about his own body.

"Yeah," she said. "I can work with it. But we're starting from fundamentals. I don't care how fast he is—if his technique stays this bad, he's going to break his own hands the first time he hits something solid."

"Fair enough," Marcus said.

Zara moved back to the center of the mat. "Okay, break's over. Now we work on forms. Proper stance, weight distribution, guard position. Boring stuff, but it's the foundation. If you're going to have reflexes like that, we might as well teach you how to use them properly."

Kyr4n returned to the mat, taking position where she indicated.

For the next hour, Zara drilled him on fundamentals. Stance. Guard. Weight transfer. Breathing. The boring mechanical components of fighting that most students hated but that separated amateurs from professionals.

Kyr4n absorbed it with that same analytical focus, asking precise questions about angles and efficiency. Like he was learning a new programming language rather than combat techniques.

"Why is the fist positioned this way?" he asked during a guard position drill.

"Protects your head while keeping your striking hand ready. Efficient defense and offense from the same position."

"But if I angle it more toward—"

"No. Trust me. Standard guard exists for a reason. Once you master the basics, you can experiment. But fundamentals first."

"Understood."

The mechanical acceptance was almost frustrating in its simplicity. No ego, no resistance, just systematic learning like he was assembling a machine.

But there were moments—brief flashes—where something else showed through. When she demonstrated a particular combination, his eyes tracked the movement with predatory focus. When she adjusted his stance, his body responded to her touch with awareness that seemed to extend beyond normal human perception.

And once, when she deliberately invaded his space to correct his guard position, she felt... something. Like static electricity, almost. A awareness of her proximity that made her enhanced senses tingle with warning signals she couldn't properly interpret.

She stepped back, filing that away for later analysis.

"Okay," she said finally, checking the time. "That's enough for today. Two hours. Tomorrow we'll drill these fundamentals again, then start building on them. You'll be sore tonight—those muscles aren't used to this kind of work."

"I don't get sore," Kyr4n said absently, reaching for his shirt.

Zara and Marcus both looked at him.

"What?" Zara asked.

"I don't get sore from exercise. Haven't since..." He paused, like he'd started to say something and thought better of it. "Since a few years ago. My body recovers quickly."

"Everyone gets sore from new exercise," Zara said flatly. "It's lactic acid buildup, micro-tears in muscle tissue. Biology."

"I'm aware of the biology," Kyr4n said. "I'm just telling you it doesn't seem to apply to me anymore."

Zara looked at Marcus, who shrugged slightly—an admission that yes, this was also unusual.

"Fine," she said. "If you're not sore tomorrow, we'll increase the intensity. See if we can find your actual limits."

"That seems reasonable," Kyr4n agreed.

As he pulled his shirt back on, Zara found herself studying him with new interest. Not attraction—purely professional curiosity. Like encountering a puzzle that didn't match its appearance.

Terrible technique. Exceptional physical response. Spatial awareness that bordered on supernatural. No muscle fatigue. Speed and power beyond what his build suggested.

Marcus had said "something like genetic optimization." But Zara had worked with gene-modded individuals before, and they didn't move like this. Didn't have this particular combination of trained incompetence and physical excellence.

"Same time tomorrow," she said. "And bring proper training gear. I'll send you a list."

"Understood."

As Kyr4n headed for the exit, Zara turned to Marcus. "Okay. I need more information. What actually is he?"

"Someone who took down Rico Vasquez and his inner circle in under five minutes," Marcus said. "That's all you need to know for now. Train him. Teach him proper technique to channel what he can already do. The rest will become clear with time."

"You said that yesterday."

"It's still true."

Zara watched Kyr4n disappear up the stairs, her tactical wetware still processing the session's data. The disconnect between what she'd observed and what should be possible for a baseline human.

"One more question," she said. "Those two assassination attempts you mentioned. The professionals who tried to take him out. How did they fail?"

Marcus's expression went distant, remembering. "They assumed he was vulnerable. Made their moves based on what they could see—baseline human, no obvious weapons, no backup. They were wrong about all of it."

"How wrong?"

"The kind of wrong where you don't get a second chance to correct your assessment."

Zara absorbed that, running calculations. If professionals had failed despite seeing the same pattern she was seeing—untrained civilian appearance masking something else—then either Kyr4n had hidden weapons she hadn't detected, or his physical capabilities were even more unusual than she'd observed.

Or both.

"This is going to be interesting," she said quietly.

"That's one word for it," Marcus agreed. "You sticking with the job?"

Zara thought about it. Thought about the puzzle Kyr4n represented. The challenge of training someone whose body responded in ways she couldn't fully explain. The professional satisfaction of protecting someone who was clearly more than they appeared.

And underneath all of that, something else. Curiosity. The same instinct that had driven her to survive refugee camps, excel in corporate training, break from her handlers. The need to understand what she didn't know.

"Yeah," she said. "I'm sticking with it. But I'm going to figure out what he actually is."

"Good luck," Marcus said, and there was something almost like sympathy in his tone.

"I don't need luck. I need data." She started gathering her training equipment. "And tomorrow, I'm going to push him harder. Find his actual limits."

"Looking forward to seeing how that goes," Marcus said, definitely amused now.

Zara shot him a look. "You think I can't?"

"I think you're going to have a very educational experience."

As she headed for the exit, Zara was already planning tomorrow's session. More aggressive combinations. Stamina testing. Stress scenarios. She'd find the boundaries of whatever made Kyr4n unusual.

And maybe, in the process, she'd understand why Marcus seemed so unconcerned about protecting someone who looked so completely vulnerable.

Behind her, Marcus smiled to himself and headed back to his office, already anticipating Zara's growing realization about what—or who—she'd actually agreed to protect.

This was going to be entertaining to watch.
