## The Scene

### Part 1: Professional Normalcy

The morning briefing ran with the same efficient precision as every other morning briefing. Marcus presented security updates. Kaia reported on intelligence gathering. Dr. Vasquez outlined medical infrastructure improvements. Kyr4n listened with focused attention, asked targeted questions, made decisions with calm authority.

Zara stood three feet behind and to the left of his chair, exactly where she always stood, scanning the room with automatic threat assessment protocols her enhanced systems ran without conscious thought.

Professional. Normal. Unchanged.

Except for the hyper-awareness of his presence that made her catalog every movement—the way his fingers tapped against the armrest twice when considering a decision, the slight shift in his posture when Marcus proposed increasing patrol rotations, the particular tone his voice took when he was about to disagree with someone.

She'd noticed these things before. But now they meant something different. Now she knew what those hands felt like pinning her wrists, what that voice sounded like dropping to dark command, what control looked like when it finally slipped.

"Zara."

She blinked. Kyr4n had turned slightly in his chair, looking at her with mild inquiry. The briefing had ended. Everyone else was filing out. She'd missed the dismissal.

"Yes, Boss?"

"Territory inspection today. South sector water distribution system. The new filtration units need evaluation."

"Understood. I'll prep the security detail."

"Just us." He stood, gathering his datapad. "The installation team will be there, but I want to assess without a convoy. Lower profile."

Marcus paused at the door, frowning. "Boss, after the assassination attempt—"

"Which is exactly why conspicuous security draws attention." Kyr4n's tone was patient but firm. "Zara can handle it."

Marcus looked at her. She nodded once—professional acknowledgment. He left, still frowning.

When the room emptied, Kyr4n moved toward the exit. "Ready?"

"Two minutes. Need to check the route and confirm the installation team's verified."

"Efficient."

It was. It was also an excuse to not be alone with him in the elevator, to maintain the careful distance she'd been maintaining for three days. Professional. Normal. Unchanged.

Even though her marks had faded to yellow-green shadows and she could feel their absence like a missing tooth her tongue kept finding.

### Part 2: The Territory Inspection

The South Shore water distribution facility occupied a converted industrial building—concrete and steel infrastructure from the old automated era, now repurposed with Kyr4n's rehabilitation improvements. The new filtration units gleamed with fresh installation, technicians making final adjustments while their supervisor explained capacity increases to Kyr4n.

Zara maintained perimeter awareness, standing far enough back to give him space for conversation but close enough to respond to threats in under two seconds. Professional distance. The same distance she always maintained.

"—increase clean water access by forty percent," the supervisor was saying. "With the sewage treatment upgrades, we're looking at sustainable infrastructure for the first time in—"

"Fifteen years," Kyr4n finished. "Since corporate maintenance contracts ended and Rico decided water purification was an unnecessary expense."

The supervisor nodded. "People were buying bottled water from corporate vendors at markup prices. Now they'll have clean water from the tap. It matters, Boss."

"It does." Kyr4n studied the filtration arrays with focused attention. "How long until full operational capacity?"

"Three days for testing, then we go live."

They discussed technical specifications—flow rates, contamination filters, backup systems. Zara listened with half her attention, the other half scanning the facility. Two technicians by the main array. One supervisor. Four workers on the upper level doing maintenance. All verified. No threats.

Normal. Professional. The work they'd been doing for weeks.

Except she kept noticing how Kyr4n moved—that economical grace, the way he touched the equipment with careful precision, the particular tone his voice took when explaining something technical. The same person he'd always been.

She just knew things about him now that changed how she saw everything else.

When the inspection finished, they walked through the South sector market back toward headquarters. Mid-afternoon crowds, vendors hawking synthetic proteins and grey-market tech, the familiar sounds and smells of the Slums functioning with slightly more stability than it had under Rico's brutal efficiency.

"The water project is working," Zara observed. Professional small talk. The kind they'd been making for three days.

"It's a start." Kyr4n paused at a fruit vendor, examining what looked like actual apples—rare, expensive, probably smuggled from corporate agricultural zones. He bought two, handed her one.

She took it, surprised. "Boss, I can't accept—"

"You can. I'm not bribing my bodyguard with fruit, Zara. Just sharing lunch."

She bit into the apple. Real. Sweet. The taste was almost shocking after weeks of synthetic rations.

They walked in comfortable silence, eating fruit that cost more than most people in the Slums made in a week, two professionals doing their jobs with the ease of established routine.

"You're doing good work here," she said finally. "The water, the medical access, the fair protection rates. It matters."

"Thank you." He glanced at her, something unreadable in his expression. "That means something, coming from you."

"Why?"

"Because you don't give empty compliments. If you say something matters, you mean it." He finished his apple, disposed of the core in a reclamation bin. "Also, you're observant. You see the details most people miss."

The compliment landed strangely. Not awkward, just... genuine. Like he'd been thinking about it for a while.

"I notice things," she agreed carefully.

"Yes." He didn't elaborate, but something in his tone suggested he knew exactly what she'd been noticing. "We should head back. I have a meeting with the Guild representatives at sixteen hundred."

They walked back through familiar streets, professional distance maintained, conversation easy. Normal. Exactly how they'd been functioning for three days.

And it was fine. She could do this. Could maintain boundaries, perform her duties, keep the physical separate from professional.

Except the marks had faded completely now. And the memory of what those hands could do kept intruding during briefings. And she'd made a decision three days ago that she hadn't acted on yet.

The neural bridge. The request that terrified and compelled her in equal measure.

She needed to ask. Had been working up courage for three days.

Today. She'd ask today.

### Part 3: The Request

Back at headquarters, Kyr4n headed for his quarters to review briefing materials before the Guild meeting. Zara followed automatically—bodyguard duty included securing his personal space before leaving him alone.

Standard protocol. She'd done it a hundred times.

Except this time, when she finished checking corners and closets and potential threat vectors, she didn't immediately leave.

"Clear," she reported, then paused at the door. "Boss, can I ask you something?"

He looked up from the datapad he'd been scrolling through. "Of course."

She'd rehearsed this. Knew what she wanted to say. But standing here, trying to articulate it, the words felt impossible.

"The interrogation technique," she started. "What you did with Wells. The... neural extraction. The way you—" She stopped, regrouped. "I want you to do that to me."

His expression shifted. Not surprised, exactly. More like he'd been expecting this and dreading it.

"Why?"

"Because I need to understand." The words came faster now, momentum overriding hesitation. "Why I'm wired wrong. Why violence feels like safety. Why being overpowered feels like trust. There's something broken in my head and I need to know what it is, when it started, why—"

"You're not broken."

The flat certainty in his voice stopped her.

"Zara, you're not broken," he repeated, setting down the datapad. "You're adapted. Shaped by trauma into someone who survived. That's not the same thing."

"Then why do I need—" She gestured vaguely, unable to articulate. "Why do I feel right when someone's hurting me?"

"Because someone hurt you when you were helpless, and now you're choosing to recreate that dynamic with someone who won't actually harm you. It's a trauma response. Adaptive, not broken." His voice was gentle but firm. "You don't need neural extraction to understand that."

"But I do." She moved closer, intensity bleeding through professional control. "I need to see it. All of it. The memories I've buried, the moment it started, everything that made me—this."

"No."

The word landed with quiet finality.

"Boss—"

"Zara, what I did to Wells was necessary. Life-saving intelligence, time-critical situation, and he was—" Kyr4n's jaw tightened. "He was expendable. A hostile target. If something had gone wrong, if the extraction had damaged his neural architecture, that would have been acceptable risk."

"I'm asking you to take the risk," she insisted.

"And I'm refusing." He stood, moving toward her with careful deliberation. "You're not expendable. You're not a hostile target. You're—" He stopped, searching for words. "You matter. To the organization. To..." He didn't finish.

"I need this."

"You need therapy, not neural violation." His voice carried unexpected heat. "What you're asking for—Zara, it's not simple. Wells had specific information stored in recent accessible memory. Easy to locate, easy to extract. What you want to know could be anywhere in your neural architecture. Buried in childhood memory structures, fragmented across multiple processing centers, encoded in trauma responses that activate different neural pathways. I'd be searching blind through your entire psychological history."

"Then search."

"It would take weeks. Possibly months." He was fully engaged now, explaining with the same focused intensity he brought to technical problems. "Multiple sessions, each one carrying risk of damage. Memory fragmentation. Personality disruption. And that's assuming I could even find what you're looking for. The brain buries trauma for protection. Forcing access could—"

A knock at the door interrupted.

They both froze. Professional distance shattered by the sudden realization they'd been standing close, voices raised, having an intensely personal conversation while she was supposed to be on bodyguard duty.

"Boss?" Alex's voice through the door. "Guild representatives are early. Kaia needs you for tactical assessment before the meeting."

Kyr4n's expression smoothed to professional calm. "Two minutes."

"Copy that."

Footsteps retreating.

Silence stretched between them. Zara felt the conversation's interruption like a physical blow—argument unfinished, need unmet, frustration building.

"We're not done discussing this," she said quietly.

"Yes, we are." His voice was gentle but absolute. "I won't risk you, Zara. Not for this. Find another way to understand yourself."

"There is no other way."

"Then learn to live with not understanding." He moved past her toward the door, gathering his datapad. "You're adapted, not broken. That's enough."

It wasn't enough. Not even close.

But he was already at the door, already shifting into Boss mode, already leaving the conversation behind with the same efficient compartmentalization he brought to everything.

"Resume your duties," he said, not unkindly. "I'll be in conference room three."

Then he was gone, leaving her standing in his quarters, marks faded, request refused, frustration building like pressure behind a dam.

She'd asked. He'd said no. For reasons that were protective, practical, probably even correct.

And she hated all of them.

Because she didn't want his protection. Didn't want his practical concerns. Didn't want to be valued enough that he refused to risk her.

She wanted answers. Wanted to understand. Wanted someone to go into her head and pull out the truth no matter how buried or dangerous or painful.

Wanted him to stop treating her like she mattered more than the mission.

Except—

He valued her. Not her usefulness. Not her capabilities. Her. The person. Enough to refuse something she desperately wanted because the risk was unacceptable.

The same thing that had broken her walls three days ago. His care. His concern. His valuing her survival over results.

She touched her wrist where the bruises had been. Felt only smooth skin. The evidence had faded.

But the need hadn't.

If he wouldn't give her mental vulnerability, she'd take the physical kind again. Would push him until that careful control cracked. Until he stopped protecting her and just took what she offered.

Until she felt that overwhelming strength paired with chosen restraint. The paradox that felt like home.

She left his quarters, resumed bodyguard duties, stood outside conference room three while he conducted meetings with Guild representatives about trade routes and protection contracts.

Professional. Normal. Unchanged.

While inside, she made a decision.

She'd try again. Not the neural bridge—he'd made his position clear. But the other thing. The physical thing that worked when words failed.

Soon. When the marks faded completely and the need became unbearable.

She'd go back to his quarters and demand what she understood how to ask for.
