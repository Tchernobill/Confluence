The tunnel exit opened onto a service alley choked with condensation pipes and rusted grating. Kyr4n stepped through, servo components heavy in his messenger bag, and didn't process the wrongness fast enough.

Movement. Too close. Too fast.

Hands slammed into his chest—massive, civilian-clothed, no armor plating but plenty of mass behind them. His back hit concrete hard enough to punch the air from his lungs. The bag's strap dug into his shoulder. His skull bounced off the wall.

"Hello, Artisan."

The voice carried none of the mechanical amplification from the market three weeks ago, but Kyr4n recognized it anyway. Kane. The enforcer he'd left on the ground with a blown servo and a philosophical question.

Out of uniform. Alone.

_Oh._

The analytical part of his mind—the part that had mapped servo vulnerabilities and calculated leverage points—noted Kane's civilian jacket, the absence of gang colors, the empty alley. No backup. No witnesses. Just the two of them in the failing light filtering through overhead grating.

The rest of his mind, the part currently drowning in static and the memory of sounds through thin walls, registered a detached observation: _This is how I die, then._

The resignation felt almost comfortable. Easier than the alternative. Easier than going back to the workshop where the partition walls broadcast every intimate moment he didn't want to hear. Easier than watching Isa's gold-flecked eyes light up for someone who could actually make her laugh like that.

"No jammer," Kane observed, one hand still pinning Kyr4n's coat collar. "Stupid of you. Coming to The Gut without protection." His grip tightened. "Or maybe you wanted to get caught."

Kyr4n's ribs ached where they pressed against the wall. His eye—still healing from the last beating—throbbed in time with his pulse. He should feel fear. He should feel _something_.

"Maybe," he heard himself say. Quiet. Factual.

Kane's expression shifted—something between anger and confusion. "Three weeks, I've been thinking about what I'd do when I found you. Been carrying this around." He shifted his weight, and Kyr4n saw the knife in his other hand. Not standard issue. Personal. "You humiliated me. In front of everyone. Left me on the ground like garbage."

"Yes." Still that flat tone. Like confirming a technical specification.

"And you're just... what? Giving up?" Kane's voice rose, genuine frustration bleeding through the intimidation. "Where's the smart-ass who asked me about death? Where's the bastard with the gun?"

The PitBull MKIII sat in his inner jacket pocket. Within reach. Might even get it clear before Kane used that knife. Probably not. The mathematics were poor.

And the other mathematics—the ones that kept calculating how many days until Riley moved his things fully into the living quarters, how many more mornings of hearing Isa's contented silence through walls that weren't walls—those felt worse.

"That question," Kyr4n said, and was mildly surprised his voice worked at all. "The one I asked. 'Is this how you saw your death?'"

Kane's jaw tightened. "Yeah. That question. Been stuck in my head like a fucking earworm. You think you're clever—"

"It just came out." The words emerged without conscious direction, like they'd been waiting. "I wanted you to think. To reflect. About what you were doing with your existence. Hurting others. Taking from them." A pause. His chest hurt. Everything hurt. "That question was the only thing that came out of my mouth that might make you stop."

Silence. Just the distant hum of market activity bleeding through walls, the drip of condensation somewhere in the darkness.

"Stop," Kane repeated. His grip hadn't loosened. "Not 'think about your sins' or some philosophical bullshit. Just... stop."

"Everything deserves a second chance to work properly," Kyr4n said. "Even broken people."

"Broken." Kane laughed—sharp, bitter. "That what I am? Broken?"

"We all are." Kyr4n met his eyes. Still that strange calm, like watching himself from outside. Like none of this mattered because nothing mattered anymore. "Different specifications. Different failure modes. Same fundamental problem."

Kane studied him for a long moment. The knife blade caught the dim light, casting geometric shadows across the alley wall.

"You're fucked up," Kane finally said. But some of the heat had left his voice. "What are you even doing here? Market's dangerous territory for someone with a bounty."

"Buying servos." Factual. "For a repair project."

"That's not what I meant." Kane shifted his stance. Not releasing him, but the pressure eased fractionally. "You look like shit. Worse than when I punched you. And you didn't even try to defend yourself just now." A pause. "What happened?"

The laugh that escaped Kyr4n's throat surprised them both. Dry. Empty.

"I found out the person I—" He stopped. Started again. "I'm being replaced. By someone better. Someone who can..." He couldn't finish. The words stuck somewhere in his chest, sharp and choking.

Kane's expression did something complicated. "That why you're letting yourself get killed in a back alley?"

"If I die, I die." The same flat tone. "Seemed... efficient."

"Efficient." Kane released his collar, stepped back. The knife disappeared into his jacket. "You're crazier than I thought." He ran a hand through his hair—a surprisingly human gesture without the helmet. "Look. Despite the humiliation—and it was fucking humiliating, by the way—you spared my life. Could've shot me with that miniature cannon you carry. Didn't."

Kyr4n straightened slowly, his back still against the wall. Processing.

"So I'm going to spare yours," Kane continued. "But listen carefully. If I see you in public—especially with other enforcers around—I will kill you. Can't show weakness. You understand that, right?"

A nod. Mechanical.

"Bounty on your head is small. Corporate property damage, minor assault on contracted security. Expires in two months if you keep your head down." Kane studied him. "You planning to keep your head down?"

"I don't know." Honest.

"Figure it out." Kane turned to leave, then paused. "And for what it's worth—that person replacing you? If they can't see what you're worth, they're the broken ones. Not you."

Then he was gone, footsteps echoing down the alley until the darkness swallowed them.

Kyr4n stood there for a long time. The servo components in his bag felt impossibly heavy. His ribs ached. His eye throbbed. The wall behind him radiated the day's accumulated heat through his jacket.

Somewhere above, past the grating and condensation pipes and layers of rust, the sky existed. He couldn't see it from here.

_If I die, I die._

But apparently not today.

He pushed off the wall, adjusted the bag's strap, and walked in the opposite direction from Kane's departure. Each step felt mechanical. Deliberate. Like following an algorithm whose purpose he'd forgotten.
