Here is the breakdown of the beats and events for the previous scene, covering the return from the bar to Kyr4n’s retreat into the ventilation shaft.

### Part 1: The Stage
**Location:** Phoenix Recovery Workshop (Night/Early Morning)
*   **Event:** Kyr4n finishes the "urgent" work on the power cells in 40 minutes.
*   **Event:** Kyr4n spends over three hours waiting in the dark.
*   **Beat:** Kyr4n deliberately stages a tableau of exhaustion (slumped posture) to avoid having to interact or be vulnerable when they return.

### Part 2: The Intrusion
**Location:** Phoenix Recovery Workshop
*   **Event:** Isa and Riley enter at 02:14, drunk, loud, and stumbling.
*   **Event:** They discover Kyr4n "passed out" on the workbench.
*   **Beat:** Isa touches Kyr4n’s hair/shoulder with drunken affection; the tenderness hurts Kyr4n because he feels he is deceiving them, yet craving the touch.
*   **Event:** Riley and Isa joke about Kyr4n being "grumpy and technical" and having a "factory setting."
*   **Beat:** Kyr4n internalizes the "factory setting" comment, confirming his self-image as a utility droid rather than a person.

### Part 3: The Exclusion
**Location:** Phoenix Recovery Living Quarters (The Threshold)
*   **Event:** Isa and Riley leave the workshop and enter the bedroom together.
*   **Event:** The door locks; sounds of intimacy (zippers, rustling, murmurs) bleed through the thin walls.
*   **Beat:** Kyr4n lies frozen, listening to the evidence of his exclusion, confirming that the "work" excuse was accepted too easily because they wanted to be alone.

### Part 4: The Realization
**Location:** Phoenix Recovery Workshop
*   **Event:** Kyr4n waits ten minutes to ensure they won't come back out.
*   **Event:** He sits up and looks at the completed power cells (fully charged, green lights).
*   **Beat:** He realizes they didn't even look at the work; the task that "prevented" him from going out was irrelevant to them.

### Part 5: The Retreat
**Location:** Ventilation Gantry/Shaft
*   **Event:** Kyr4n decides he cannot stay in the workshop or the bedroom.
*   **Event:** He climbs the ladder to the cramped, dusty ventilation gantry.
*   **Beat:** He defines his status as "Obsolete" and uses the deafening mechanical noise of the air recyclers to drown out the sounds of Isa and Riley, finding safety in isolation.
