Here is the breakdown of the beats and events for the first scene in the sequence, covering the "laundry incident" through to Kyr4n’s departure on the train.

### Part 1: The Laundry Incident
**Location:** Isa’s Container Unit
*   **Event:** Isa cleans up her cluttered space while Kyr4n prepares food/drinks; the atmosphere is domestic.
*   **Event:** Isa finds Riley’s shirt and trousers on the floor right next to the bed and jokes about becoming his "laundry service."
*   **Beat:** Kyr4n freezes. The visual evidence of Riley’s presence in the bed (where Kyr4n was days ago) triggers a system shock.
*   **Beat:** Kyr4n engages the "Protective Mask," forcing himself to act indifferent and "disorganized" regarding Riley, masking his jealousy.
*   **Beat:** Kyr4n spirals internally, comparing Riley’s natural fit in the world ("he belongs") to his own need to be invisible ("placeholder").
*   **Event:** Isa casually invites Kyr4n to sit on the bed (where the clothes were); he refuses, using a lie about "grease on his pants" to maintain distance.
*   **Event:** The ventilation unit rattles; Kyr4n immediately fixes it.
*   **Beat:** Isa praises him ("This is why I keep you around"), unintentionally reinforcing Kyr4n’s belief that his value lies solely in his utility/function, not his personhood.

### Part 2: The Market Errand
**Location:** South Shore Central Market
*   **Event:** They purchase power cells from a vendor.
*   **Beat:** Isa calls them a "good team" (Charm + Silence), but Kyr4n internally reclassifies this as "Operations and Logistics" rather than a partnership.
*   **Event:** They meet Riley at the transit hub; Riley greets them with physical exuberance.
*   **Beat:** Kyr4n observes the instant, high-energy chemistry between Isa and Riley (the "closed loop") and feels like a static observer.

### Part 3: The Departure
**Location:** Street leading to Sector 4 (Entertainment District)
*   **Event:** The group walks toward the clubs; sensory overload (noise, lights, crowds) begins to hit Kyr4n.
*   **Beat:** Kyr4n visualizes the night ahead: him sitting alone guarding jackets while they dance. He decides he cannot be the "buzzkill."
*   **Event:** Kyr4n stops and tells them he is heading back.
*   **Event:** He constructs a technical lie about the power cells (electrolyte crystallization) requiring immediate attention to justify leaving.
*   **Beat:** He waits for their reaction, terrified they will see his jealousy, yet hoping they might fight for him to stay.
*   **Event:** Isa and Riley accept the excuse easily, telling him not to work too hard.
*   **Beat:** Their easy acceptance confirms his logic loop: they are happier without him.

### Part 4: The Commute
**Location:** Transit Platform & Train
*   **Event:** Kyr4n walks away without turning back.
*   **Beat:** The physical pain of the heavy bag serves as a grounding mechanism against the emotional pain.
*   **Beat:** Kyr4n defines them as a "binary star system" and himself as a "satellite" passing through the dark.
*   **Event:** He rides the empty train back to the workshop alone, accepting his isolation as the correct, logical state.
