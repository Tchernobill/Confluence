The metal walkway was still warm from the day's heat, radiating up through the thin soles of Kyr4n's boots. Two in the morning, and the Stacks hummed with their usual insomnia—distant voices through container walls, the clank of someone descending stairs three levels up, music bleeding from a unit across the alley. But here, on this makeshift balcony welded to Isa's container, the noise felt distant enough to almost be peaceful.

Kyr4n leaned against the railing, forearms crossed on the warm metal, looking down at the alley twelve meters below. The angle reminded him of his ventilation shaft—that compressed perspective of looking at the world from between walls. Except this time, he'd chosen to be here rather than hiding.

Progress, maybe.

The door scraped behind him.

He didn't turn, but his shoulders relaxed fractionally at the familiar sound of her movements. She always dragged the door instead of lifting it properly—he'd offered to fix the track at least twice, but she'd just laughed and said it made a good alarm system.

"Can't sleep?" Isa's voice was rough with interrupted sleep, soft in the way it only got when they were alone.

"Didn't mean to wake you."

"You didn't." The walkway vibrated with her footsteps. "Your side of the mattress got cold. That wakes me up now, apparently."

He glanced back, and something in his chest did that thing it had started doing around her—that brief suspension of normal function that wasn't quite comfortable but wasn't unwelcome either.

She wore one of his shirts. Just that. The fabric hit her mid-thigh, worn soft cotton hanging loose on her frame. One shoulder had slipped free, the neckline pulling sideways, and she hadn't bothered to adjust it. Her hair was sleep-mussed, and she padded barefoot across the metal grating like she didn't notice the texture pressing patterns into her soles.

It wasn't that she looked deliberately sexy—she didn't. She looked like someone who'd rolled out of bed at 2am to check on a person she cared about, wearing whatever was closest, completely unconcerned with how she appeared. The lack of performance made it somehow more—

"You're staring." But she said it without self-consciousness, coming to stand beside him at the railing.

"Sorry."

"I didn't say stop." She leaned her hip against the railing, studying his profile. "What's keeping you up?"

He didn't have a good answer. Just a restlessness that had pulled him from the warm tangle of limbs and sheets, a need for space and air that felt like betrayal given how recently he'd started allowing himself to stay close to her at all.

"Brain won't stop," he said finally. Which was true enough—his thoughts had been cycling through tomorrow's work, Sedh's latest developments, the strange satisfaction of having someone waiting in a bed when he came back. Too many inputs. Too many new patterns his mind kept trying to process.

Isa hummed, not pushing. She tilted her head back, looking up at the container stack rising above them. "Nice night for it, at least."

It was. The usual smog had cleared somewhat—probably wind patterns shifting. You could almost see stars between the industrial haze. The temperature sat in that perfect range where skin felt comfortable exposed to air, where breathing didn't require thinking about.

She shifted beside him, and then her head came to rest against his shoulder—gentle, casual, like it was the most natural thing in the world. The weight was warm and solid and immediately grounding.

Kyr4n exhaled and let his temple rest against the crown of her head.

They stood like that for a while, not talking. Below, the alley stretched in both directions, lit by scattered lights from ground-level units. Trash bins and scattered debris. A few people still moving around despite the hour—the Slum never really slept.

Movement caught his eye. Small, quick. Four legs.

"There," he said quietly, nodding downward.

A cat emerged from behind a bin, pale orange and bone-thin. It sniffed at something on the ground, tail twitching. A moment later, a second cat appeared—darker, moving with that particular careful arrogance cats managed.

"Poor things," Isa murmured. "Probably starving."

"Probably."

She watched them for another moment, then straightened abruptly. "Hold on."

Before he could ask, she disappeared back into the container. Kyr4n listened to her moving around inside—a drawer opening, soft cursing, something falling over. The cats below had discovered some kind of standoff over whatever scrap they'd found, circling each other with tails puffed.

Isa returned holding a small cylinder. "Found it."

A laser pointer. Cheap one, probably salvaged from a presentation pointer. She grinned at him—that particular smile that suggested impending mischief—and flicked it on.

The red dot appeared on the alley floor below, bright against the stained concrete.

Both cats froze. Ears forward. Bodies tense.

Isa moved the dot in a small circle.

The orange cat pounced. Missed. The dot moved. The dark cat scrambled after it, skidding on loose debris. They collided in a tangle of limbs and offended yowls.

Kyr4n felt his mouth curve without deciding to smile.

"Your turn." Isa pressed the pointer into his hand, her fingers warm against his palm.

He took it, adjusting his grip, and sent the dot skittering across the ground. The cats gave chase immediately, and he found himself tracking their movements, predicting their paths, leading them in patterns that made them leap and scramble and generally make fools of themselves.

"You're evil," Isa said, laughing softly as the orange cat tried to pin the dot against a wall and ended up pawing at concrete. "Also possibly the first time I've seen you play with something that isn't electronics."

"It's basically electronics."

"It's a cat toy, Kyry."

"A cat toy that works via—"

"Nope." She leaned into his side, her shoulder against his ribs. "No technical explanations. Just cats being dumb. That's the whole point."

He moved the dot in a tight spiral, watching the cats try to track it, and something in his chest loosened. "They are pretty dumb."

"Endearingly dumb." She watched for a moment. "Kind of like you, sometimes."

"Thanks."

"I mean it affectionately." Her voice had that teasing warmth that meant she was smiling. "You're brilliant about anything you can take apart and understand. But put you in a social situation and you're like—" she gestured vaguely, "—a really smart cat trying to figure out why it can't catch the red dot."

He should probably be offended by that. Somehow he wasn't.

The orange cat made a particularly spectacular leap and landed in a crouch, looking around frantically for where the dot went. Kyr4n put it right in front of its face, and the cat reared back like it had been ambushed.

Isa laughed—that whole-body laugh that came out when something genuinely delighted her. "Okay, that was perfect timing."

He turned off the pointer. Below, the cats sniffed around for another few seconds before apparently deciding the game was over and slinking off to whatever territories they'd carved out in the Slum's margins.

"Cruel to stop," Isa said, but she was still smiling. "They were having fun."

"So were we." The words came out before he could think about them. Simple truth.

Isa looked at him, and something shifted in her expression—softened, went quiet. "Yeah. We were."

The weight of her attention felt different than usual. Not the patient assessment she'd had when they first met. Not the careful navigation of his boundaries. This was something simpler. Easier.

She reached up, fingertips brushing his jaw, turning his face toward hers. "You know what I like about you?"

"My technical skills?"

"Well, yes. Obviously." Her thumb traced his cheekbone. "But also this. You at two in the morning, playing with cats because I handed you a laser pointer. Not thinking. Not analyzing. Just—" she paused, searching for words, "—here."

His throat felt tight. "I'm always analyzing."

"Mm. Less, though." She studied him. "You're less with me now. Less in your head. More—" she made a vague gesture that somehow encompassed his whole body, the space between them, "—present."

"Is that good?"

"It's very good." She leaned in, pressed her forehead to his. "Kyry. It's really good."

They stood like that, breathing the same air, the Stacks humming around them with all their usual chaos. Kyr4n felt the warmth of her skin, the slight pressure of her weight as she leaned into him, the way his mind had finally—mercifully—gone quiet.

"Thank you," he said. Not sure exactly what he was thanking her for. All of it, maybe.

Isa's hand slid down to his chest, palm flat over his heart. "You keep saying that like I did something special. I just—" she paused, "—I just like you. Is all."

"That's special enough."

"Sap." But she said it warmly, and her hand stayed where it was.

A breeze moved through the alley below, warm and industrial-scented. Somewhere a few levels up, someone was playing music—something with bass that vibrated through the metal structure. The whole Stack felt alive in the way it only did at night, when the heat of the day released and the shadows filled with people too restless or too desperate to sleep.

"Come back to bed," Isa said eventually. "Not because you have to. But because—" she shrugged, "—it's nicer than being out here alone."

"I wasn't alone."

"No." She squeezed his hand. "You weren't. That's kind of the point."

She tugged him toward the door, and he followed. But he paused at the threshold, looking back at the alley below. The cats had reappeared, settling near each other with that careful distance cats maintained while still seeking proximity.

Kyr4n understood that. The push and pull of wanting closeness but needing space. The way connection could feel both essential and terrifying.

But maybe—maybe it was getting easier. The door closing behind them. Isa's hand in his. The fact that going back to bed meant going back to someone, not just back to sleep.

Maybe that was enough.

For now, anyway.
