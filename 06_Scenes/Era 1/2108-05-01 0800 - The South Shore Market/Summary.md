## Scene Information

**Summary**: Kyr4n arrives at the South Shore Central Market and sets up his modest repair booth in his usual corner location. Throughout the six-hour workday, he handles multiple clients—from routine data pad repairs to complex neural interface calibrations—demonstrating the exceptional technical skills that have earned him "The Artisan" nickname among underground dealers. He navigates brief interactions with regular vendors Marcus (a fence) and Dr. Nyx (who warns of increased corporate surveillance), establishing his place in the market's professional community while maintaining the careful emotional distance necessary for survival. By day's end, he's earned enough credits for the week's expenses plus a small margin, before preparing to leave for his evening scavenging run.

**POV Character(s)**: Kyr4n (close third-person limited throughout)

**Timeline**: Afternoon of May 1, 2108, 09:30-16:00 (6.5 hours). Immediately follows Scene 1.01.002 (Surface Protocol - tunnel journey to market). Kyr4n is 18 years old, approximately 6 months after mother's death. "The Artisan" reputation is recent but growing organically through word-of-mouth.

**Location(s)**:

## Scene Beats

1. **Settling into competence**: Arrival uncertainty → familiar setup routine → comfortable professional mode (this is his element, his confidence space)

2. **Establishing rhythm**: Empty stall → first client arrives → repair completed → payment received → pattern established (workday routine, sustainable survival)

3. **Complexity graduation**: Simple repairs → more complex implant work → challenging neural interface → demonstrates depth of expertise (not just survival, but mastery)

4. **Professional community**: Solo work → Marcus stops by → casual business exchange → professional respect acknowledged (he's not completely isolated—has functional relationships)

5. **Information economy**: Routine work focus → Dr. Nyx brings surveillance news → underlying tension introduced → continued work with new awareness (background threat entering consciousness)

6. **Flow state**: Conscious technical work → deep focus on neural interface → hands moving by feel and intuition → transcendence through mastery (his meditation, his peace)

7. **Pride versus modesty**: Internal satisfaction with work quality → external modest presentation → balance between confidence and safety (can't appear too successful or become target)

8. **Transactional comfort**: Professional exchanges flowing smoothly → hints at personal questions from clients → visible discomfort → retreat to technical discussion (comfort with business, awkwardness with personal)

9. **Reputation building**: Individual repairs → satisfied clients mentioning him to others → "The Artisan" recognition spreading → growing visibility creating tension (success threatens safety)

10. **Economic knife-edge**: Tallying earnings → week's expenses covered → small margin remaining → relief mixed with awareness of precarity (always one crisis from disaster)

11. **Community acknowledgment**: Packing up alone → exchanges with regular vendors → subtle nods of respect → part of ecosystem despite isolation (belongs professionally if not personally)

12. **Transition preparation**: Market work complete → shift to scavenging mindset → different skills, different risks → preparing for discovery that changes everything (routine about to shatter)
