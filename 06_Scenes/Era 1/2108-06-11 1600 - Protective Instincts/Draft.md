The cafe was one of those rare quiet spots that survived in The Cluster through sheer stubbornness—a converted shipping container with a few mismatched tables and tea that didn't taste like industrial runoff. Riley had claimed the corner table where he could watch both the entrance and the street beyond, his messenger bag propped against the wall, body language radiating the kind of relaxed satisfaction that came from a day's work completed without incident.

He was halfway through his second cup when a familiar voice cut through the ambient noise.

"Riley! Hey!"

He looked up to see Isa threading her way between tables, hazel eyes bright with those gold flecks that meant she was either excited or up to something. Probably both, knowing her. She'd spotted him from the street, apparently, and was waving like they were old friends instead of people who'd known each other for maybe three months.

Well. Maybe they were old friends now. Time moved differently in the Slum—you either trusted someone or you didn't, and Isa had earned that trust pretty quickly.

"Isa." He gestured to the empty chair across from him. "Road been good to you?"

"Can't complain." She dropped into the seat with easy grace, already flagging down the server. "You?"

"All deliveries intact, no checkpoints gave me grief, and I found this place." He lifted his cup in salute. "I'd call that a win."

"Mmm, this place is great." She leaned forward conspiratorially. "The owner's got connections to someone who smuggles actual tea leaves from outside the Citadel territories. Not that synthetic crap."

"You're kidding."

"Would I lie about tea?" Her grin was infectious. When the server approached, she ordered without hesitation. "Whatever he's having. Double."

Riley raised an eyebrow. "Rough day?"

"More like an interesting week." She settled back in her chair, studying him with that assessing look she probably didn't realize she did. "You look good, though. Courier life treating you well?"

"Can't complain. How about you? How's business?"

Isa's expression brightened, the gold flecks in her eyes catching the light. "Actually really good. Phoenix Recovery's reputation is spreading—we're getting clients from territories I didn't even know had heard of us. Kyr4n's work speaks for itself."

"That's great." Riley smiled, genuinely pleased. "You've both worked hard for it."

"We have." She accepted her tea from the server with a nod of thanks. "Though I'll be honest, the business side is easier when your partner is a technical genius. Makes the sales pitch a lot simpler when you can actually deliver miracles."

"You're doing more than just sales," Riley observed. "From what I've seen, you're the one who makes people feel safe enough to trust you with their broken things. That's not nothing."

Her smile turned warmer. "Thanks. That means a lot." She wrapped both hands around the cup, breathing in the steam. "Speaking of broken things and trust... there was an incident. Couple weeks ago."

Something in her tone made Riley sit up straighter. "What kind of incident?"

"The kind involving your mutual friend and a corporate enforcer with a god complex."

Riley's stomach dropped. "Kyr4n? Is he—" He was already calculating routes to the workshop, mentally cataloging which medical supplies he had in his bike's saddle bags. "Is he okay? Where is he?"

Isa held up a hand, and despite the situation, amusement flickered across her face. "Breathe, courier boy. He's fine."

"You just said there was an incident with an enforcer." Riley's voice came out sharper than intended. "Those don't usually end with 'fine.'"

"Okay, fine might be stretching it. He had some bruising. Nothing serious." She took a sip of tea, watching him over the rim with those perceptive eyes. "But he's not in any danger. Not anymore."

Riley forced himself to sit back, trying to recapture his earlier calm and failing. "What happened?"

"Well..." Isa's expression shifted into something between concern and what looked suspiciously like pride. "You know that enforcer who's been squeezing the market vendors? Kane?"

"Unfortunately." Everyone knew Kane. The man was a sadist with a badge, the kind of corporate enforcer who used his position to terrorize people for entertainment. "He went after Kyr4n?"

"Went after the whole market, but yeah, Kyr4n specifically." Isa set down her cup, fingers still wrapped around the ceramic for warmth. "Fabricated some violation, started throwing his weight around. Got physical."

Riley's hands clenched on his own cup. "That bastard. Kyr4n's not..." He stopped, searching for words. "He's not exactly built for fighting enforcers."

"That's what I thought too." Isa's smile turned knowing. "But listen to the rest."

Riley took a breath. "Okay. What happened?"

Isa leaned back, and a proud look crossed her face. "Our boy held his own."

Riley blinked. "What?"

"I mean, don't get me wrong—he took some hits. Kane got in a good punch before things really started. But Kyr4n..." She paused, seeming to search for the right words. "He's got moves I didn't know about."

"Moves." Riley's brain wasn't processing this properly. "Kyr4n. The guy who practically lives underground and flinches when you get too close too fast."

"That's the one." Isa's grin widened. "Turns out our tech genius has something serious hiding under all that social anxiety."

Riley sat back, trying to reconcile this information with the person he knew. "Tell me."

Isa's eyes lit up. "So Kane's being his usual charming self, right? Slammed Kyr4n's payment on the floor, demands he pick it up like a dog. I'm ready to intervene—I've got my shock baton, figure I can at least create a distraction—but before I can move, Kane just punches him."

Riley's jaw tightened.

#todo Fix fight sequence with actual Enforcer Incident event.

"Kyr4n goes down," Isa continued. "And I'm thinking, shit, this is bad. Kane's reaching for his sidearm, and I'm calculating whether I can cross the distance before he draws, and then—" She paused for dramatic effect. "And then Kyr4n moved. I mean really moved. Not panicked flailing—tactical. He swept Kane's legs out from under him. Like, smoothly. Professionally."

"You're kidding."

"I am not." She was grinning now. "Kane hits the ground, loses his weapon, and suddenly our introverted tech specialist has the upper hand. It was... impressive."

Riley shook his head slowly. "And he's okay now? Really okay?"

"Some bruising. Ego bruised more than anything, I think." Isa's expression softened. "He retreated to his hideout afterward, needed time to process. But yeah, he's okay."

Relief washed through Riley, and he felt his shoulders relax for the first time since Isa had mentioned the incident. "Good. That's... good."

"See? Nothing to panic about." Isa's smile was gentle, understanding.

Riley took a sip of his tea, letting the warmth ground him. "People like us," he said quietly, "we need to watch out for each other."

"People like us?" Isa tilted her head, curious.

Riley met her eyes, his expression turning thoughtful. "Nice, smart, and attractive people."

Isa's eyebrows rose, and that mischievous glint appeared in her hazel eyes. "Oh really?" She leaned forward, resting her chin on her hand. "So you think Kyr4n's attractive?"

Riley felt heat creep up his neck. "I—that's not—I mean—"

"Riley." She was grinning now, clearly enjoying his flustered response. "It's okay. He is attractive. In that whole 'brilliant bird' kind of way." She paused, her smile turning playful. "And me?"

"What?" Riley's brain was still catching up.

"Do you find me attractive?" She asked it so casually, like she was inquiring about the weather, but there was something warm and interested in her expression that made Riley's pulse quicken.

He recovered enough to smile back. "I think you know the answer to that."

"Maybe." She picked up her tea, taking a slow sip while maintaining eye contact. "But it's nice to hear it confirmed."

They sat in comfortable silence for a moment, something new and electric humming in the air between them. Riley found himself noticing details he'd registered before but not really seen—the way Isa's hair caught the afternoon light, the curve of her smile, the intelligence and warmth in those gold-flecked eyes.

"So," Isa said eventually, breaking the moment but not the mood, "now that you know Kyr4n's okay and secretly badass, are you going to go check on him anyway?"

Riley considered lying, then decided it wasn't worth the effort. "Probably."

"Good." She stood, draining the last of her tea. "He's at the workshop. Has been working himself to exhaustion since the incident—I think processing through technical problems is his version of therapy."

"That sounds like him." Riley stood as well, shouldering his messenger bag.

"Riley?" Isa paused, one hand on the back of her chair. "For what it's worth, I'm glad he has you. We both need to keep an eye on him. Make sure he doesn't disappear too far into his own head."

"Agreed." Riley met her eyes. "And Isa? I'm glad he has you too."

Her smile was warm, genuine. "Yeah, well. Someone has to keep track of the brilliant wounded birds." She started to turn, then paused. "You should visit him. Tonight, maybe. He might not say he needs company, but..."

"But he does," Riley finished.

"Exactly."

She took a step toward the exit, and Riley found himself speaking before he'd fully thought it through. "Isa?"

She turned back, eyebrows raised in question.

"Do you have any plans for the weekend?"

The smile that spread across her face was radiant. "Are you asking me out, courier boy?"

"Maybe." He matched her smile with one of his own. "Depends on your answer."

"Well." She moved back toward him, close enough that he could smell the faint scent of motor oil and something floral—an interesting combination that somehow suited her perfectly. "I think I could probably clear my schedule. For the right invitation."

"There's a night market in Sector 5. Less corporate presence, good food, decent music." Riley kept his voice casual despite the way his heart had picked up speed. "Thought it might be nice to explore it with someone who appreciates actually good tea."

"That sounds..." Isa's eyes sparkled with those gold flecks. "Really nice, actually."

"Saturday evening? I could meet you at the workshop around sunset."

"It's a date." She said it definitively, then added with a playful grin, "A date where we're both watching out for each other. Nice, smart, attractive people and all that."

Riley laughed. "Exactly."

She reached out, her hand briefly touching his arm—warm, deliberate, promising. "Saturday, then. Don't forget to check on our brilliant wounded bird first, though."

"I won't."

She left with a wave, disappearing into the afternoon crowd with that easy confidence, but this time there was an extra spring in her step. Riley sat back down, not quite ready to leave yet, a smile playing at his lips.

He thought about Kyr4n—brilliant, terrified, secretly trained Kyr4n—facing down an enforcer and winning. Then he thought about Isa, who saw past surfaces to the complicated people underneath and still chose to care. And he thought about Saturday evening, and the interesting possibility of getting to know her better.

People like us, he thought. Nice, smart, attractive people who looked out for each other.

Yeah. He could work with that.
