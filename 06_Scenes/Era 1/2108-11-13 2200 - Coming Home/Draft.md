---
Riley's shoulder protests as he works his key into the lock—two weeks of sleeping on courier bunks and navigating rough territory has left him sore in creative places. The door swings open to warm lamplight and the sight of Isa curled on his sleeping mat, looking up with a smile that makes the aches worth it.

"You're back," she says, unfolding gracefully.

"I'm back." He drops his courier bag with relief, catches her as she launches herself at him. She smells like the soap from Phoenix Recovery, warm and familiar. "How'd you get in?"

She pulls back, dangling a key between them. "Kyr4n made me a copy. Said you'd given him one, and if we're..." She waves vaguely. "You know. Us. All of us. Then I should have one too."

Something warm settles in Riley's chest. Keys mean trust. Mean home instead of temporary stop. "He's right."

"Also he said you wouldn't mind and I should stop overthinking and just take it." Her smile turns wry. "He's getting better at the direct approach."

"Yeah?" Riley guides them toward the mat, sinking down with a grateful groan. "How is he?"

"Good." Isa's whole face lights up. "Actually good. We talked. Really talked. Like, three-hour 'I'm going to say the hard thing and you're going to actually tell me how you feel' talked."

Riley studies her expression—no performative brightness, no manic energy trying to cover guilt. Just genuine warmth. "And?"

"He told me..." Isa settles cross-legged facing him, taking his hands. "Everything. How finding out about us felt like confirmation he was insufficient. How he's been trying so hard to be okay with it that he forgot to actually *be* okay. How scared he's been that he's the problem we'll eventually solve by not including him."

Riley's chest tightens. "Isa—"

"I know. I *know*." Her grip tightens. "I heard him. Actually heard him. Not just waited for my turn to apologize and make it about my fear of losing people." She takes a breath. "I apologized for real. For being selfish. For using you to feel good about myself while he was quietly breaking. For making 'everyone said it's okay' enough when it clearly wasn't."

"What did he say?"

"That he doesn't want me to stop being with you. He wants..." She smiles, something soft and wondering. "He wants all of us to be honest. To actually talk about feelings, not just logistics. To check in for real."

Riley nods slowly. It sounds like Kyr4n—finding the logical framework to build something healthy. "How are you with that?"

"Terrified," Isa admits. "But in a good way? Like, it's going to be hard work. But it's real work. Not just..." She waves a hand. "Pretending and hoping everything fixes itself."

"I'm proud of you." Riley means it. He can see the difference in her—still Isa, still warm and impulsive, but with something steadier underneath. "That took guts."

"It took hurting someone I love and almost losing everything because I was too scared to look at my own shit." Her expression turns playful. "But yes, also guts."

Riley pulls her closer, kisses her forehead. She melts against him, comfortable and easy. This—this feels right. Not desperate or hollow. Just... good.

"So," Isa says after a moment, voice carefully casual. "Speaking of Kyr4n and honesty..."

"Oh no. That tone."

She pulls back, eyes sparkling. "He kissed you."

Riley's brain temporarily stops functioning. "He... what?"

"Before you left. Two weeks ago." Isa's grin is delighted. "He told me. Well, after I asked if anything happened while I was being oblivious and self-absorbed. And he got this *look*, and I was like 'oh my god, what,' and he said..." She affects a terrible impression of Kyr4n's measured tone. "'I kissed Riley. I wanted to. I asked if he wanted me to. He said yes.'"

Riley's not breathing properly. The memory surfaces—Kyr4n walking him to the door before his job, both of them lingering. The way Kyr4n had looked at him, something vulnerable and determined in those sharp blue eyes.

*Can I... would you want me to kiss you?*

And Riley, surprised but not, feeling something click into place that had been building for months. *Yeah. I would.*

The kiss had been... careful at first. Kyr4n learning, testing, then suddenly sure. His hand cupping Riley's face, thumb brushing his cheekbone. The taste of coffee and something sharp. The way Kyr4n had made a small sound when Riley kissed back, like he hadn't quite believed Riley would.

Riley had left for his courier job three minutes later, head spinning, no time to process.

Two weeks on the road, he'd thought about that kiss. The memory of Kyr4n's mouth, the surprising intensity, the way something in Riley's chest had opened up and said *oh*.

"Riley?" Isa's watching him closely. "You okay?"

"I... yeah." He meets her eyes. "He kissed me."

"I gathered that." Her expression is warm, curious, completely without jealousy. "How was it?"

"Isa—"

"No, I'm serious. How was it?" She shifts closer, taking his hands again. "I want to know. I'm not—this isn't me being threatened or jealous or whatever. I'm genuinely asking."

Riley searches her face, finds only authentic curiosity and warmth. Something in him relaxes. "It was... intense. He initiated, which surprised me. Asked first, very Kyr4n about it. But then when I said yes, he just..." Riley shakes his head, remembering. "Committed. Like he does with everything. Complete focus."

"Was it good?"

"Very good." Riley feels heat creep up his neck. "I kept thinking about it. The whole two weeks. Just... replaying it."

"Yeah?" Isa's smile is delighted. "Tell me more."

"You're enjoying this."

"Immensely." She squeezes his hands. "Riley, the man I care about kissed the other man I care about, and apparently it was intense and good and you've been thinking about it for two weeks. Why wouldn't I be enjoying this?"

Riley laughs, helpless. "When you put it that way..."

"So." Isa leans closer, playful and warm. "Details. Was there tongue? Where did he put his hands? Did he make any sounds?"

"Isa!"

"What! I wish I'd been there. Since I wasn't, I want the full report." Her grin turns wicked. "Come on. Share with the class."

Riley shakes his head, but he's smiling. "Okay, yes, there was tongue. He..." Riley closes his eyes, remembering. "He cupped my face. Kissed me careful at first, then... not. Like once he knew I wanted it, he just went for it. And he made this sound—surprised, maybe. Like he couldn't quite believe I was kissing back."

"Oh my god, that's so him." Isa's eyes are bright. "Brilliant genius who can't believe someone wants him."

"Yeah." Riley opens his eyes, meets her gaze. "Isa, I think... I think I have feelings for him. Real feelings. Not just—I find him attractive, or I care about him as a friend. But like... romantic feelings."

Saying it out loud makes it real. The two weeks of processing, the way his chest had opened up during that kiss, the constant replay in his mind. He's not just attracted to Kyr4n. He's falling for him.

Isa's expression softens into something beautiful. "Oh, Riley."

"Is that... okay?"

"Okay? Riley, that's *wonderful*." She cups his face the way Kyr4n had. "You love him. Or you're starting to. And he kissed you, which means he's feeling something too. How is that anything but wonderful?"

"I was worried... with you and me, and you and him, that if I..."

"If you fall for him too, there's not enough love to go around?" Isa's eyes are steady, clear. "That's not how it works. Love doesn't diminish when it expands. It just... grows. Makes room."

"You really believe that."

"I'm learning to." Her smile turns wry. "Kyr4n said something during our talk. He said 'Isa loving Riley doesn't mean she loves me less. It means she has more love in her life. Unless I make it a competition, it's just... more.' And I realized he was right. Me being happy for you and him doesn't take away from us."

Riley pulls her into a kiss, deep and grateful and a little amazed. When they break apart, he rests his forehead against hers. "How did we get so lucky? You two?"

"We did the work." Isa's voice is quiet, serious. "We had the hard conversations. We're still learning. But yeah... I think we might actually figure this out."

They stay close for a moment, just breathing together. Then Isa pulls back slightly, something shifting in her expression.

"What?" Riley asks.

"I want..." She takes a breath. "I want to stop talking about Kyr4n now."

Riley blinks, surprised.

"Not forever," Isa clarifies quickly. "And not because I don't care. But because..." She traces his jawline, gaze intent. "I missed *you*. I want to be with you. Not us talking about him, or processing the triad, or figuring out complicated feelings. Just... us. You and me. This connection, right here."

Something warm floods Riley's chest. "Yeah?"

"Yeah." Isa's smile is tender, certain. "I love that you're falling for him. I love that he kissed you and you kissed back and feelings are happening. But right now, I want this to be about us. Our thing. Just Riley and Isa, in this moment."

Riley understands immediately—the importance of individual connections within the larger whole. Not everything has to be about the three of them. Sometimes it can just be two.

"Okay," he says softly. "Yeah. Just us."

Isa kisses him, and this time it's different—not exploratory like their first time, not desperate like the second. This is reunion. Homecoming. Two people who know each other choosing to be together, for their own sake, in their own right.

Riley pulls her closer, hands finding familiar places—the curve of her waist, the soft skin at the nape of her neck. Isa makes a pleased sound, fingers threading into his travel-mussed hair.

"You need a shower," she murmurs against his mouth.

"Probably."

"Don't care." She pushes him back onto the mat, following him down. "Missed you too much to wait."

They undress each other with easy familiarity, touches that know where to go, what makes the other gasp. When Isa straddles him, settling down slowly with a sigh of satisfaction, Riley thinks this—*this* is what it's supposed to feel like. Present. Connected. Right.

"Missed this," Isa breathes, rolling her hips. "Missed you."

"Missed you too." Riley's hands map her body, relearning after two weeks away. "So much."

They find a rhythm together, easy and building. Isa leans down to kiss him, slow and deep, moving against him in steady waves. Riley meets her movement, hands guiding her hips, learning what makes her breath catch.

This time when she comes, it's with his name on her lips and genuine joy in her eyes. No hollowness. No guilt. Just pleasure and connection and the simple beauty of two people choosing each other.

Riley follows her over the edge, Isa's hands framing his face, her eyes locked on his. The moment feels suspended—perfect and complete and exactly what they both needed.

Afterward, they curl together on the narrow mat, skin cooling, hearts slowing. Isa's head rests on Riley's chest, his fingers tracing lazy patterns on her shoulder.

"Better than debugging a fried system?" she asks, playfully referencing what must be an old joke with Kyr4n.

Riley laughs, chest vibrating under her. "Different but equal category. Incomparable data sets."

"Nerd."

"You like it."

"I really do." She tilts her head up to look at him. "I like you. This. Us."

"Me too." Riley kisses her forehead. "Thank you for giving me space for both. You and him."

"Thank you for having room for both of us." Isa settles back against his chest. "I think... I think we're going to be okay. All three of us. It won't be easy, but..."

"But we're doing the work." Riley feels profound contentment settle over him. "Real work. Honest work."

"Yeah."

They lie in comfortable silence as the lamplight creates warm shadows. After a while, Isa speaks again, voice drowsy.

"When you see him next... when something happens with you two..." She pauses. "I meant what I said. I wish I'd been there for the kiss. For whatever comes next. If you both want that. If I'm welcome."

Riley's hand stills on her shoulder. "You'd want to be there?"

"If you both wanted me there. If it felt right." She props herself up to meet his eyes. "Not to control it or make it about me. But because... I love you both. And seeing people I love being happy together sounds..." Her smile is soft, genuine. "Amazing."

"We'd have to ask Kyr4n. See what he's comfortable with."

"Of course." Isa settles back down. "Just... putting it out there. Whatever shape this takes, whatever we all need individually and together... I'm here for it. For real this time."

Riley holds her closer, overwhelmed by affection for this complicated, impulsive, genuine person who's learning and growing and trying so hard.

"I love you," he says quietly.

Isa's breath catches. "Yeah?"

"Yeah. Messy feelings and all."

"I love you too." She presses a kiss over his heart. "And him. And this weird, complicated, beautiful thing we're building."

"Beautiful thing," Riley echoes, smiling into the darkness.

Outside, South Shore settles into night—the distant sounds of territory life, the hum of generators, the occasional shout or laugh. Inside Riley's apartment, two people rest in the aftermath of genuine connection, making space for love that doesn't diminish when it expands.

When Riley wakes in the morning, Isa still curled against him, his first thought is about the work ahead. Talking to Kyr4n about what the kiss meant. Figuring out how three people navigate complicated feelings. Building something that honors all their individual needs while creating something larger together.

It won't be easy.

But looking at Isa's peaceful face, remembering the intensity of Kyr4n's kiss, feeling the contentment of their night together—Riley thinks it might be worth it.

More than worth it.

Everything.
