The rooftop smelled like rust and ozone, the way everything on The Cluster's edge did when the day's heat started releasing from metal containers stacked forty meters high. Kyr4n sat with his back against a ventilation unit, legs drawn up, watching the Citadel's towers catch the last of the sunlight across the poisoned river. From here, you could almost forget the container blocks surrounding him on three sides, almost imagine the view went on forever instead of ending at another Stack's wall three hundred meters away.

Almost.

The access hatch scraped open behind him. Kyr4n's shoulders tensed—automatic assessment of threat vectors, exit routes, defensive positions—before Riley's voice called out, easy and warm like always.

"Thought I might find you up here."

The tension bled out. Just Riley. Just... Riley.

"How did you..." Kyr4n started, then stopped. The words felt clumsy in his mouth.

Riley crossed the rooftop with that loose-limbed confidence born from spending half his life on a motorcycle, settling down beside Kyr4n without asking permission. Close enough that Kyr4n could smell road dust and engine grease, far enough to not crowd. The courier had an instinct for these things—reading invisible boundaries most people crashed through without noticing.

"Saw you heading up the maintenance ladder about an hour ago," Riley said, stretching his legs out and tilting his head back to catch the dying light. "Figured you'd either be working on something or just... sitting." He glanced at Kyr4n with a soft smile. "Hoping it was the second one, actually. Been looking forward to some good company."

"Sitting," Kyr4n confirmed quietly. Then, because it felt necessary: "The bike's... it should run better now. Fixed that fuel mixture issue. The timing adjustment too."

Riley's smile widened, something warm flickering in his dark eyes. "See? Knew you'd figure it out. You've got magic hands for mechanical work." He paused, tilting his head. "Among other things, I'd imagine."

Kyr4n's fingers found the hem of his worn work shirt, worrying at a loose thread. "Just... basic diagnostic work. The compression readings were off, so I adjusted the—"

"Kyr," Riley interrupted gently, amusement coloring his voice. "I'm trying to thank you. You don't have to explain the technical details."

"Oh." Kyr4n felt heat creep up his neck. "Right. You're welcome."

They sat in silence for a moment, Riley's presence steady and unhurried beside him. The courier had this way of making silence feel comfortable instead of awkward, like just existing beside someone was enough.

"It's quiet up here," Kyr4n said eventually. "Good spot for... for thinking."

"Thinking about what?" Riley asked, and there was something in his tone—not quite curiosity, not quite flirtation, but somewhere in between. "Or should I say who?"

Kyr4n blinked, confused by the knowing smile on Riley's face. "What?"

"Nothing." Riley's grin turned playful. "You just have this look. Like something's taking up space in that brilliant head of yours."

"I met someone today," Kyr4n said, still processing Riley's strange expression. "Potential customer. She..." He paused, uncertain how to articulate what had unsettled him. "She's... a bit like you, actually."

Riley's eyebrows rose. "Like me how?"

"She looked at me like..." Kyr4n struggled for words. "Not just my work but me me." He pulled his knees closer to his chest, protective. "She's an underground implant dealer. She seem to knows her stuff, really knows it. Professional. But..."

"But?" Riley prompted gently.

"I have the feeling there's... more to it." The words came out reluctantly. "Find her interest a bit suspicious. People don't usually... they don't look at me like that. Like I'm..." He gestured helplessly, unable to finish.

"Interesting?" Riley supplied, his voice carrying a warmth that made Kyr4n's chest tighten. "Worth getting to know? Maybe even attractive?"

Kyr4n shot him a confused look. "Suspicious," he corrected firmly. "People want something when they look at you like that. Information, access, leverage."

Riley made a soft sound that might have been a laugh or a sigh. "I looked at you like that. You know, Kyr, sometimes people are just interested because they find you interesting. No ulterior motive required."

"That doesn't make sense. Interesting how?"

"Like..." Riley shifted slightly closer, until their shoulders nearly touched. "Maybe she sees what I see. Someone nice and genuine and completely unaware of how rare that combination is." He paused, then added softly, "You're not playing someone, you're you, no pretences or demonstration. Some people appreciate that"

Kyr4n frowned, processing this. "But that would mean she wants to... what? Form some kind of ongoing connection? That's inefficient. We're doing business. Simple exchange of services for payment."

Riley's smile turned tender, almost fond. "Sure, Kyr. Simple business."

"I mean, you and I are different," Kyr4n continued, missing the look entirely. "We're... friends. That's different than a customer relationship. With her, I need to be careful. Professional boundaries. Can't trust that kind of attention when there's no logical reason for it."

"No logical reason," Riley repeated, and there was something in his voice—gentle amusement mixed with what might have been affection. "Right. Because clearly the only reason anyone would want to spend time with you is if they have some kind of scheme."

"Exactly," Kyr4n said, relieved Riley understood. "You get it."

Riley laughed then, a warm sound that filled the space between them. "Oh, I get something, all right." He nudged Kyr4n's shoulder with his own. "Come on, lean back. You're wound tighter than a compression spring."

Kyr4n allowed himself to relax slightly, letting his shoulder press against Riley's. The contact was warm, grounding. Safe in a way very few things were.

They sat in comfortable silence while the sky shifted from amber to purple-grey. Below, The Cluster's evening rhythms began—voices echoing up from street level, the distant clatter of cooking pots, someone's music drifting from an open container door.

"You know," Riley said eventually, his voice soft, "you fixed my bike without me asking. Wouldn't even let me pay you. Just did it because you noticed something was wrong."

"It was a simple repair. Took maybe twenty minutes. And it was fun"

"But you didn't have to do it," Riley continued. "You just... wanted to. Maybe this implant dealer is the same way. Maybe she just wants to know the person behind the technical genius. No conspiracy required."

Kyr4n considered this, unconvinced. "That seems unlikely."

"Why? I wanted to know you. Still do." Riley's fingers found a piece of loose gravel on the rooftop, turning it over in his palm. "Actually, I keep finding excuses to be around you. Must be some kind of elaborate scheme on my part."

"You're different," Kyr4n said automatically. "You're honest. Direct. You don't... play games."

"And maybe she doesn't either." Riley let the gravel drop, dusting off his hands. "Maybe she's just drawn to someone interesting. Can't blame her for that." He glanced at Kyr4n sideways, something playful in his expression. "I certainly understand the appeal."

"The appeal of what?"

Riley's laugh was softer this time, affectionate. "Never mind." He shifted, stretching his legs out. "You want my actual advice? Give her a chance. See what happens. Worst case, you're right and she's got some angle. Best case..." He trailed off meaningfully.

"Best case what?"

"Best case, you make another friend. Someone who sees you the way you deserve to be seen." Riley's voice dropped slightly. "And trust me, Kyr—you deserve to be seen."

Kyr4n felt something warm and uncomfortable twist in his chest. "I don't know what that means."

"I know," Riley said gently, and the tenderness in his voice made Kyr4n's breath catch. "That's what makes you so..."

"So what?"

Riley smiled, shaking his head. "Nevermind. Just... think about it, okay? Maybe not everyone who shows interest is out to get you. Maybe some of us just think you're worth the effort."

"Us?" Kyr4n asked, puzzled.

"Nice and smart people," Riley corrected smoothly, but there was amusement dancing in his eyes.

The Citadel's lights began flickering on across the river, transforming the towers into constellations of corporate power. Riley pointed at one particularly bright tower.

"See that one? Rode past it last week on a delivery run. Security was so tight I had to take a three-hour detour." He glanced at Kyr4n. "Would've been worth it though, if you'd been there. Would've made the boring parts less boring."

"I'm not sure how my presence would affect your boredom levels," Kyr4n said seriously.

Riley's expression softened into something that looked almost like wonder. "No, you really don't, do you?" He leaned his head back against the ventilation unit. "That's... that's actually kind of perfect."

"What's perfect?"

"Nothing. Everything." Riley's hand moved, coming to rest on the rooftop between them—not quite touching Kyr4n, but close enough that the intention was clear. An offering. "Just glad I found you up here. Been thinking about you most of the day."

"About the bike repair?"

"Sure," Riley said, his smile going soft. "About the bike repair."

Kyr4n frowned slightly, sensing he was missing something but unable to identify what. Riley had this way of saying things that felt like they meant more than the actual words, but Kyr4n could never quite decode the subtext.

"You're being strange tonight," Kyr4n observed.

"Am I?" Riley's eyes crinkled with suppressed amusement. "Maybe you're just finally noticing."

"Noticing what?"

"Nothing important." Riley's hand shifted slightly closer. "Just that some of us don't need suspicious motives to want to spend time with you. Some of us just... want to."

"But why?"

Riley laughed then, warm and genuine. "You know what? I'm not going to explain it. You'll figure it out eventually." He stood, stretching, then offered his hand to Kyr4n. "Come on. Let's get some food. I know a place near Sector 4 that won't poison us too badly."

Kyr4n took the offered hand, letting Riley pull him to his feet. Riley held on a moment longer than necessary, thumb brushing across Kyr4n's knuckles in a gesture that felt deliberate but whose meaning escaped Kyr4n entirely.

"There," Riley said softly. "Not so bad, right? Letting someone in?"

"You're already in," Kyr4n said, confused. "We're friends."

Riley's smile turned achingly tender. "Yeah, Kyr. We are." He released Kyr4n's hand reluctantly. "And maybe that implant dealer wants the same thing. Maybe she saw someone worth knowing. Stranger things have happened."

"I guess," Kyr4n said doubtfully.

"Trust me on this one," Riley said, heading toward the access hatch. "I've got good instincts about these things. About people. About..." He paused, glancing back with that warm, knowing smile. "About what matters."

Kyr4n followed him down the ladder, still puzzling over the conversation. Riley's words had layers he couldn't quite parse, meanings that slipped through his fingers like water.

But the warmth in his chest remained, solid and real. Riley's presence did that—made the world feel less hostile, less complicated. Made isolation feel like a choice instead of a necessity.

Maybe Riley was right. Maybe he should give the implant dealer a chance. If she could make him feel even a fraction as good as Riley did, maybe that wouldn't be so terrible.

Behind them, the stars emerged overhead, and Riley hummed something soft and content as they descended into The Cluster's evening noise.
