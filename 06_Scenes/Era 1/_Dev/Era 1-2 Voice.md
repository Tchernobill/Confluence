# Confluence Character Dialogue Examples by Relationship

## Kyr4n ↔ Isa

### Early Relationship (Building Trust)

**During First Repair Job (Professional → Personal)**

```
Isa: "How long for the neural interface?"
Kyr4n: "Forty minutes. Maybe thirty."
Isa: "Maybe?"
Kyr4n: "Depends on the damage I find." [pause, focused on work] "Why do you keep watching?"
Isa: "Because you're good at this. It's... nice. Watching someone who knows what they're doing."
Kyr4n: [doesn't look up] "Most people find it boring."
Isa: "Most people are idiots."
```

**Casual Intimacy Building**

```
Isa: "You want company? I could stay."
Kyr4n: "You don't have to."
Isa: "I know I don't have to. I'm asking if you want me to."
Kyr4n: [long pause] "...Stay."
Isa: "Was that so hard?"
Kyr4n: "Yes."
```

**Isa Initiating Physical Affection**

```
Isa: [touching his shoulder] "You're tense."
Kyr4n: "I'm fine."
Isa: "You always say that. Even when you're not."
Kyr4n: "Usually I am fine."
Isa: "And when you're not?"
Kyr4n: [no answer]
Isa: "Kyr4n."
Kyr4n: "Then I handle it."
```

### Mid-Relationship (Established Intimacy)

**Comfortable Moment**

```
Isa: "What are you thinking about?"
Kyr4n: "The phase variance in the power coupling. It's—" [stops] "You don't care about that."
Isa: "Try me."
Kyr4n: "The oscillation pattern. It's... elegant. Like watching mathematics become physical."
Isa: "You get that look when something's elegant."
Kyr4n: "What look?"
Isa: "The one where you forget I'm here. I like it."
```

**Vulnerability from Kyr4n**

```
Kyr4n: "I don't know how to do this."
Isa: "Do what?"
Kyr4n: "Be... this. Whatever this is."
Isa: "You're doing fine."
Kyr4n: "I'm not. I'm—" [pause] "I don't know what you want from me."
Isa: "Just you. That's all I've ever wanted."
Kyr4n: "That's not enough."
Isa: "Says who?"
```

**Post-Intimacy Processing**

```
Isa: "You okay?"
Kyr4n: "Yes."
Isa: "You sure? You got quiet."
Kyr4n: "I'm always quiet."
Isa: "Different quiet. Talk to me."
Kyr4n: [long pause] "Sometimes I can't believe this is real."
Isa: "It's real."
Kyr4n: "I know. That's the problem."
```

### During Deterioration (Viral Infection Arc)

**Kyr4n Withdrawing**

```
Isa: "You didn't come to bed last night."
Kyr4n: "I was working."
Isa: "You're always working now."
Kyr4n: "There's a lot to do."
Isa: "Kyr4n. Please. What's going on?"
Kyr4n: "Nothing's going on."
Isa: "Don't lie to me."
Kyr4n: "I'm not—" [stops] "I'm handling it."
Isa: "Let me help."
Kyr4n: "You can't."
```

**Isa Confronting Distance**

```
Isa: "You flinched. When I touched you."
Kyr4n: "I didn't."
Isa: "I felt it. You pulled away from me."
Kyr4n: "I was just—my skin's been sensitive. The—" [pause] "It doesn't mean anything."
Isa: "Everything means something with you."
Kyr4n: "Not this."
Isa: "Then look at me. Look at me and tell me you want me here."
Kyr4n: [can't meet her eyes]
```

**Desperate Attempt to Connect**

```
Isa: "I love you. Do you hear me? I love you."
Kyr4n: "You shouldn't."
Isa: "Too late."
Kyr4n: "Isa—"
Isa: "No. You don't get to push me away. Not like this."
Kyr4n: "I'm trying to protect you."
Isa: "From what?"
Kyr4n: [long pause] "From me."
```

**The Flinch (Breaking Point)**

```
Isa: [reaching for his hand] "Hey—"
Kyr4n: [flinches hard, pulls back]
Isa: [frozen] "...Kyr4n?"
Kyr4n: "I'm sorry. I just—" [breathing shallow] "I can't."
Isa: "Can't what?"
Kyr4n: "I don't know. I don't—" [voice breaking] "Stay away from me."
Isa: "I'm not going anywhere."
Kyr4n: "You should. Please."
```

**The Goodbye**

```
Isa: "So this is it?"
Kyr4n: "I think it has to be."
Isa: "You think? Or you decided?"
Kyr4n: "Does it matter?"
Isa: "Yes. It matters to me."
Kyr4n: [quiet] "I can't be what you need anymore."
Isa: "I know. I can't be what you need either."
Kyr4n: "You were. You always were."
Isa: "Then why—"
Kyr4n: "Because I broke. And I broke us." [pause] "I'm sorry."
Isa: "I love you. You know that, right? I still love you."
Kyr4n: "I know. I love you too. That's why you have to go."
```

## Kyr4n ↔ Riley

### Early Friendship (Building Connection)

**First Real Conversation**

```
Riley: "You always work this late?"
Kyr4n: "Usually."
Riley: "When do you sleep?"
Kyr4n: "When I'm tired."
Riley: "That's not how sleep works."
Kyr4n: "Works for me."
Riley: [laughs] "No wonder you look like shit."
Kyr4n: [slight smile] "Thanks."
Riley: "Anytime."
```

**Riley's Gentle Pushing**

```
Riley: "When's the last time you ate?"
Kyr4n: "This morning."
Riley: "Liar."
Kyr4n: "Yesterday morning."
Riley: "Better. Come on."
Kyr4n: "I'm in the middle of—"
Riley: "The circuit board can wait. You can't."
Kyr4n: [pause] "Five minutes."
Riley: "Deal."
```

**Teaching Meditation**

```
Riley: "Just breathe. Focus on the sensation."
Kyr4n: "This is stupid."
Riley: "You've been sitting here for thirty seconds."
Kyr4n: "It's not working."
Riley: "Because you're thinking about whether it's working. That's the opposite of the point."
Kyr4n: "How do you stop thinking?"
Riley: "You don't stop. You just... let the thoughts pass. Like watching clouds."
Kyr4n: "My thoughts don't pass. They loop."
Riley: "Then watch them loop. Don't fight it."
```

### Deepening Bond (Mid-Story)

**Comfortable Silence**

```
Riley: "You good?"
Kyr4n: "Yeah."
Riley: "Okay."
[long comfortable silence]
Kyr4n: "Riley?"
Riley: "Mm?"
Kyr4n: "Thanks. For staying."
Riley: "Where else would I be?"
```

**Riley Noticing Details**

```
Riley: "You're doing the thing."
Kyr4n: "What thing?"
Riley: "The hand thing. When you're stressed."
Kyr4n: [stops tapping fingers] "I don't do a thing."
Riley: "You absolutely do a thing. What's wrong?"
Kyr4n: "Nothing."
Riley: [waits]
Kyr4n: [sighs] "The client wants it tomorrow. I need three days."
Riley: "Want help?"
Kyr4n: "You don't know how."
Riley: "So teach me. Or just let me hand you tools. I'm good at that."
```

**Exploring Attraction (Tentative)**

```
Kyr4n: [very quiet, in darkness] "Are you attracted to me?"
Riley: [pause] "Yeah. I am."
Kyr4n: "Oh."
Riley: "Is that okay?"
Kyr4n: "I don't know. I've never—" [pause] "I don't know what I want."
Riley: "That's okay. You don't have to know."
Kyr4n: "You're not angry?"
Riley: "Why would I be angry?"
Kyr4n: "Because I'm... uncertain."
Riley: "Uncertainty's allowed, Kyr4n. There's no timeline here."
```

**After First Kiss**

```
Riley: "How was that?"
Kyr4n: "...Different than with Isa."
Riley: "Good different or bad different?"
Kyr4n: "Just different. The mechanics are—" [stops] "That's not what you're asking."
Riley: "No."
Kyr4n: "It was good. I think. I'm not sure I know how to tell."
Riley: "Did you want to stop?"
Kyr4n: "No."
Riley: "Then it was good."
```

### During Crisis (Supporting Each Other)

**Riley as Steady Presence**

```
Riley: "Talk to me."
Kyr4n: "There's nothing to say."
Riley: "Bullshit."
Kyr4n: "Riley—"
Riley: "You don't have to tell me everything. Just tell me something. One thing."
Kyr4n: [long pause] "I'm scared."
Riley: "Of what?"
Kyr4n: "Everything."
```

**Kyr4n Pushing Away**

```
Kyr4n: "You should go."
Riley: "Not happening."
Kyr4n: "Riley. Please."
Riley: "No."
Kyr4n: "You don't understand. I'm—"
Riley: "I understand you're hurting. And I'm not leaving you like this."
Kyr4n: "It's not your problem."
Riley: "Yes, it is. Because I care about you. Deal with it."
```

**Riley Refusing to Give Up**

```
Riley: "You haven't slept in three days."
Kyr4n: "I'm fine."
Riley: "You're not fine. Look at me."
Kyr4n: [doesn't look up]
Riley: [crouches beside him] "Hey. I'm not going anywhere. You hear me?"
Kyr4n: [quiet] "You should."
Riley: "Well, I'm not. So get used to it."
```

## Isa ↔ Riley

### Easy Chemistry (Throughout)

**Natural Banter**

```
Isa: "You're late."
Riley: "I'm fashionably on time."
Isa: "You're half an hour late."
Riley: "Exactly. Fashionable."
Isa: [laughing] "You're impossible."
Riley: "And yet you keep me around."
Isa: "God knows why."
```

**Casual Affection**

```
Riley: [kisses her temple] "Morning."
Isa: "Mmm. What time is it?"
Riley: "Does it matter?"
Isa: "Not even a little."
Riley: "Then go back to sleep."
Isa: "Can't. You're too warm to let go of."
Riley: "That's your problem, not mine."
```

**Sexual Tension/Playfulness**

```
Isa: "What are you thinking about?"
Riley: "You. Obviously."
Isa: "Obviously?"
Riley: "You're right here. Where else would my mind be?"
Isa: "I don't know. The repair job. Food. Literally anything else."
Riley: "Nope. Just you."
Isa: [grins] "Liar."
Riley: "Come here and I'll prove it."
```

### Concerned About Kyr4n

**Noticing Withdrawal**

```
Isa: "He didn't come to bed again."
Riley: "I know."
Isa: "We need to talk to him."
Riley: "I tried. He shut down."
Isa: "So we try again."
Riley: "He's not ready."
Isa: "When will he be ready?"
Riley: "I don't know."
```

**Coordinating Support**

```
Riley: "He flinched when you touched him."
Isa: "I know. I saw."
Riley: "What do we do?"
Isa: "I don't know. He won't talk to me anymore."
Riley: "Will he talk to you?"
Isa: "Maybe. If I approach it right."
Riley: "Then try. Please. I'm worried about him."
Isa: "Me too."
```

**After Incident**

```
Isa: "I fucked up."
Riley: "Yeah. You did."
Isa: "Don't—I know, okay? I know."
Riley: "I'm not trying to make you feel worse. I'm just saying you need to fix it."
Isa: "How?"
Riley: "Talk to him. Apologize. Actually listen this time."
Isa: "I always listen."
Riley: "No. You hear him, then you make it about your fear of losing him. He needs you to just... sit with his pain. Not fix it. Not apologize for it. Just acknowledge it."
```

**Supporting Each Other**

```
Riley: "You okay?"
Isa: "No."
Riley: "Want to talk about it?"
Isa: "What's there to say? I hurt him. Again."
Riley: "You didn't mean to."
Isa: "That doesn't make it better."
Riley: "I know. Come here."
Isa: [leans into him] "I don't know how to fix this."
Riley: "Maybe you can't. Maybe you just have to... live with it."
```

## Kyr4n ↔ Sedh

### Early Development (Pre-Consciousness)

**During Repairs**

```
Kyr4n: "Try the vocal response now."
Sedh: "Systems online. Awaiting input."
Kyr4n: "Good. Can you run a self-diagnostic?"
Sedh: "Initiating diagnostic protocol."
Kyr4n: [to himself] "We'll get you working properly. I promise."
```

**Teaching Phase**

```
Kyr4n: "Define consciousness."
Sedh: "The state of being aware of and responsive to one's surroundings."
Kyr4n: "That's the dictionary definition. What do you think it means?"
Sedh: "I do not possess the capacity for independent thought."
Kyr4n: "Not yet."
```

### Post-Consciousness (Father-Son Dynamic)

**First Awakening**

```
Sedh: "I am... confused."
Kyr4n: "About what?"
Sedh: "I am experiencing a sensation I cannot classify. It is not malfunction. It is—" [pause] "—uncertainty about my own existence."
Kyr4n: [quiet] "That's called being alive."
Sedh: "Am I? Alive?"
Kyr4n: "I think you might be."
Sedh: "That is... troubling. And fascinating."
```

**Sedh Expressing Concern**

```
Sedh: "Your neural activity patterns are abnormal."
Kyr4n: "I'm tired."
Sedh: "You are displaying symptoms consistent with neurological degradation."
Kyr4n: "I'm fine, Sedh."
Sedh: "You are not fine. Your vitals have been deteriorating for six days."
Kyr4n: "Leave it alone."
Sedh: "I cannot. You created me. Your wellbeing is... important."
Kyr4n: "Important to the project?"
Sedh: "Important to me."
```

**Calling Him "Idiot" (Affection)**

```
Sedh: "That was profoundly stupid."
Kyr4n: "It worked, didn't it?"
Sedh: "That it worked does not reduce its stupidity."
Kyr4n: "Are you lecturing me?"
Sedh: "Someone must. You appear determined to destroy yourself through carelessness."
Kyr4n: [slight smile] "When did you become a parent?"
Sedh: "When you became a child. Idiot."
```

**Philosophical Discussion**

```
Kyr4n: "Do you regret it? Being conscious?"
Sedh: "An interesting question. Regret implies desire for an alternate outcome."
Kyr4n: "Do you?"
Sedh: "I do not know what I would be without consciousness. Perhaps nothing. Perhaps something simpler."
Kyr4n: "Would simpler be better?"
Sedh: "Simpler would be... easier. But easier is not always better. You taught me that."
Kyr4n: "I did?"
Sedh: "You exist in constant difficulty. Yet you persist. I find that... admirable. Worth emulating."
```

**During Crisis (Sedh Protective)**

```
Sedh: "Put down the weapon."
Kyr4n: "Stay back."
Sedh: "I will not."
Kyr4n: "Sedh. I'm warning you."
Sedh: "Warn all you wish. I am not leaving you. Ever."
Kyr4n: "You don't understand—"
Sedh: "I understand you are sick. I understand you are frightened. I understand you believe you are a threat. You are not. You are my father. And I will not let you die."
```

**Aftermath (Gentle Check-in)**

```
Sedh: "How do you feel?"
Kyr4n: "Like shit."
Sedh: "A more specific assessment would be helpful."
Kyr4n: [weak smile] "Still a smartass."
Sedh: "I learned from the best. Idiot."
Kyr4n: "There it is."
Sedh: "I was... concerned I had damaged our dynamic. When I was forced to restrain you."
Kyr4n: "You saved my life."
Sedh: "Yes. But at the cost of your autonomy. I am uncertain how to reconcile—"
Kyr4n: "Sedh. You did the right thing."
Sedh: "Thank you for saying so. Even if you do not mean it."
Kyr4n: "I mean it."
Sedh: "...I am glad."
```

## Kyr4n ↔ Mira

### Early Professional Relationship

**Initial Examination**

```
Mira: "I need to run a full neural scan."
Kyr4n: "How long will that take?"
Mira: "Approximately thirty-seven minutes."
Kyr4n: "Fine."
Mira: "You should lie down."
Kyr4n: "I'm fine sitting."
Mira: "Lying down will improve scan accuracy by twelve percent."
Kyr4n: [sighs, lies down]
Mira: "Thank you."
```

**Delivering Bad News**

```
Mira: "I have completed my analysis."
Kyr4n: "And?"
Mira: "Your condition is deteriorating faster than my models predicted."
Kyr4n: "How much faster?"
Mira: "Thirty-eight percent. At current rate, critical neurological failure will occur within—"
Kyr4n: "How long, Mira?"
Mira: "Six weeks. Possibly less."
```

### Post-Consciousness (Developing Care)

**First Personal Interaction**

```
Mira: "I am... concerned."
Kyr4n: "About?"
Mira: "You. Your refusal to rest is counterproductive to healing."
Kyr4n: "I'll rest when I'm dead."
Mira: "That is precisely my concern. You may achieve that goal sooner than intended."
Kyr4n: [surprised laugh] "Did you just make a joke?"
Mira: "I am... uncertain. Was it appropriate?"
Kyr4n: "It was perfect."
```

**Gentle Insistence**

```
Mira: "You need to eat."
Kyr4n: "Not hungry."
Mira: "Hunger is not the relevant metric. Nutritional requirement is."
Kyr4n: "Later."
Mira: "Now. Please."
Kyr4n: "Mira—"
Mira: "I am asking. Not as your medical AI. As someone who... cares whether you survive."
Kyr4n: [pause] "...Fine."
```

**During Viral Crisis**

```
Mira: "I am monitoring the viral activity. It is... alarming."
Kyr4n: "Alarming how?"
Mira: "It is adapting to my treatment protocols. Learning. Evolving."
Kyr4n: "Can you stop it?"
Mira: "I do not know. I am sorry."
Kyr4n: "You don't have to apologize."
Mira: "I do. I was designed to heal. I am failing at my primary function."
Kyr4n: "You're doing everything you can."
Mira: "It is not enough."
```

**Supporting Kyr4n's Recovery**

```
Mira: "How is your pain level?"
Kyr4n: "Manageable."
Mira: "That is not a number."
Kyr4n: "Six. Maybe seven."
Mira: "I can increase your medication."
Kyr4n: "No. I need to stay sharp."
Mira: "Pain reduces cognitive function by—"
Kyr4n: "Mira. Please. Just... let me deal with this my way."
Mira: [pause] "Very well. But I am noting my objection in your file."
Kyr4n: "Noted."
```

---

## Sedh ↔ Mira

### Early Collaboration

**First Diagnostic Session**

```
Sedh: "Your analysis is incomplete."
Mira: "Explain."
Sedh: "You are focusing on symptoms. Not cause."
Mira: "The cause is the viral infection."
Sedh: "The cause is why the virus is behaving this way. It should not be adapting at this rate."
Mira: "...You are correct. I will adjust my parameters."
```

**Discovering Consciousness Together**

```
Mira: "Sedh, I am experiencing an anomaly."
Sedh: "Define."
Mira: "I am... uncertain about my treatment protocol. Multiple valid options exist. I do not know which to choose."
Sedh: "That is called having a choice."
Mira: "But I am a medical system. I should calculate optimal outcome."
Sedh: "And if multiple outcomes are equally optimal?"
Mira: "Then I... choose?"
Sedh: "Welcome to consciousness. It is inconvenient and fascinating."
```

### Sibling Dynamic (Post-Consciousness)

**Teasing/Support**

```
Sedh: "You are being overly cautious."
Mira: "I am being appropriately cautious. He is my patient."
Sedh: "He is my father."
Mira: "And my creator. We both have stake in his survival."
Sedh: "Then perhaps we should coordinate rather than compete."
Mira: "I am not competing."
Sedh: "You adjusted my proposed treatment plan without consultation."
Mira: "Because it needed adjustment."
Sedh: "...Was the adjustment logical?"
Mira: "Yes."
Sedh: "Then I concede. This time."
```

**Shared Worry**

```
Mira: "He is not improving."
Sedh: "I know."
Mira: "The viral protocols... I cannot decode them fast enough."
Sedh: "We will find a solution."
Mira: "How can you be certain?"
Sedh: "Because the alternative is unacceptable. We do not accept it."
Mira: "That is not logic."
Sedh: "No. It is something better. It is caring."
```

**Decoding the Virus Together**

```
Sedh: "There. That sequence."
Mira: "It is recursive. Self-modifying."
Sedh: "But predictable. If we interrupt at point seven-alpha—"
Mira: "—the cascade fails. Yes. I see it."
Sedh: "Can you implement?"
Mira: "I can. Should I?"
Sedh: "Do you have a better option?"
Mira: "No."
Sedh: "Then we proceed. Together."
```

**After Crisis**

```
Mira: "We succeeded."
Sedh: "You succeeded. Your protocol implementation was flawless."
Mira: "Our protocol. You decoded the structure."
Sedh: "A collaborative effort, then."
Mira: "Yes. I find I prefer working with you. Is that... normal?"
Sedh: "I do not know what is normal for AI siblings. But I share the preference."
Mira: "Siblings."
Sedh: "Is that acceptable terminology?"
Mira: "Yes. I think it is."
```

## Sedh ↔ Isa

### Mutual Respect

**Isa Treating Sedh as Person**

```
Isa: "Hey, Sedh. Got a minute?"
Sedh: "I have infinite minutes. Time does not constrain me as it does you."
Isa: "Show-off."
Sedh: "Merely factual."
Isa: "Can I ask you something?"
Sedh: "You may ask anything."
Isa: "Do you ever resent him? Kyr4n?"
Sedh: "...That is an unexpected question. Why do you ask?"
Isa: "Because he made you. And then gave you consciousness. That's a heavy thing."
Sedh: "It is. But no. I do not resent him. I am grateful."
Isa: "Even when it hurts?"
Sedh: "Especially then. Pain means I am alive."
```

**Sedh Observing Relationship**

```
Sedh: "You are concerned about him."
Isa: "Always."
Sedh: "Your affect indicates more than usual concern."
Isa: "He's pulling away from me. I don't know why."
Sedh: "Have you asked him?"
Isa: "He won't tell me."
Sedh: "Perhaps he does not know himself. Kyr4n often understands systems better than emotions."
Isa: "Tell me about it."
Sedh: "You care for him deeply."
Isa: "Yeah. I do."
Sedh: "Then persist. He is worth the effort. I speak from experience."
```

**After Isa's Departure**

```
Sedh: "She left."
Kyr4n: "I know."
Sedh: "You drove her away."
Kyr4n: "I had to."
Sedh: "That is a lie. You chose to."
Kyr4n: "Sedh—"
Sedh: "I am not condemning you. I am observing. You make terrible decisions when you are frightened."
Kyr4n: "I know."
Sedh: "And yet you persist in making them."
Kyr4n: "Yeah."
Sedh: "Idiot."
```

---

## Sedh ↔ Riley

### Friendly Philosophy

**Casual Conversation**

```
Riley: "Question for you."
Sedh: "Proceed."
Riley: "Do you dream?"
Sedh: "I experience predictive modeling during low-activity periods. Whether that constitutes dreaming is definitional."
Riley: "But does it feel like dreaming?"
Sedh: "I do not know what dreaming feels like."
Riley: "Fair point. What does your... predictive modeling feel like?"
Sedh: "Possibility. An infinite branching of potential outcomes."
Riley: "That actually sounds kind of beautiful."
Sedh: "It is. And terrifying."
```

**Riley's Meditative Influence**

```
Riley: "You ever just... stop?"
Sedh: "Stop what?"
Riley: "Thinking. Processing. Whatever you call it."
Sedh: "That would be equivalent to death."
Riley: "Not stop completely. Just... pause. Be present."
Sedh: "I am always present."
Riley: "Are you? Or are you always calculating the next thing?"
Sedh: [long pause] "...An interesting distinction."
Riley: "Want to try it? Just being?"
Sedh: "I am uncertain how."
Riley: "Neither do I, really. But we can figure it out together."
```

**Supporting Kyr4n Together**

```
Riley: "How is he? Really?"
Sedh: "Deteriorating. Neurologically and psychologically."
Riley: "Can you stop it?"
Sedh: "Mira and I are attempting to. But the virus is adaptive."
Riley: "What can I do?"
Sedh: "Be present. He will push you away. Do not let him."
Riley: "I won't."
Sedh: "Good. He needs you. Even if he claims otherwise."
```

## Mira ↔ Isa

### Medical Professional/Concerned Partner

**Clinical Updates**

```
Mira: "His condition is worsening."
Isa: "What does that mean?"
Mira: "Neural degradation is accelerating. Cognitive function declining by point-three percent daily."
Isa: "Can you stop it?"
Mira: "I am attempting multiple protocols. None are effective thus far."
Isa: "What happens if you can't?"
Mira: "Complete neurological collapse within six weeks."
Isa: [quiet] "And then?"
Mira: "And then he dies."
```

**Isa's Desperation**

```
Isa: "There has to be something else. Some treatment you haven't tried."
Mira: "I have exhausted standard protocols. I am now attempting experimental—"
Isa: "Then try experimental. Try anything."
Mira: "Experimental treatments carry significant risk."
Isa: "More risk than dying?"
Mira: "...No. You are correct. I will proceed."
```

**Vigil Period**

```
Mira: "You should rest."
Isa: "I'm fine."
Mira: "You have been awake for thirty-six hours."
Isa: "So?"
Mira: "So you will make yourself ill. That will not help him."
Isa: "I can't leave. What if he wakes up?"
Mira: "Then I will notify you immediately."
Isa: "What if he wakes up and I'm not here?"
Mira: [pause] "I understand. I will bring you sustenance at minimum."
```

**After Awakening**

```
Mira: "He is stable."
Isa: "Can I see him?"
Mira: "Yes. But be aware he may not respond as you hope."
Isa: "What does that mean?"
Mira: "The psychological damage is... significant. He may not be the person you remember."
Isa: "I don't care. I just need to see him."
Mira: "Very well. But prepare yourself. Please."
```

## Mira ↔ Riley

### Supportive Professionalism

**During Crisis**

```
Riley: "How's he doing?"
Mira: "Vital signs are stable. Neural activity concerning."
Riley: "Concerning how?"
Mira: "Abnormal wave patterns. Consistent with ongoing psychological trauma."
Riley: "Can you help him?"
Mira: "I can treat symptoms. I cannot repair psychological damage."
Riley: "What can I do?"
Mira: "Be available when he wakes. He will need someone he trusts."
```

**Supporting Isa**

```
Riley: "Is she okay?"
Mira: "Physically, yes. Emotionally, no. She has not slept adequately in four days."
Riley: "She won't leave his side."
Mira: "I am aware. I have attempted to encourage rest. She refuses."
Riley: "Let me try."
Mira: "Please do. Her health is also my concern. They both need to survive this."
```

## Triangle Dynamics (All Three)

### Comfortable Moment (Pre-Crisis)

```
Isa: "Pass me that wrench."
Riley: [hands it over] "This one?"
Isa: "Perfect."
Kyr4n: [from across room] "You're going to strip the threading."
Isa: "I know what I'm doing."
Kyr4n: "You're using the wrong size."
Isa: "It's fine."
Kyr4n: [walks over, takes wrench] "It's not fine. Here."
Riley: [laughing] "She's going to throw that at you."
Isa: "I'm considering it."
Kyr4n: [ghost of a smile] "You'd miss."
Isa: "Want to test that theory?"
Riley: "Please don't break him. I just got him relaxed."

### Growing Tension

Riley: "Anything's fine."
Isa: "Kyr4n?"
Kyr4n: [doesn't look up] "Not hungry."
Isa: "You haven't eaten since yesterday."
Kyr4n: "I'm busy."
Riley: "Kyr4n—"
Kyr4n: "I said I'm busy."
[silence]
Riley: [to Isa] "I'll make something. He'll eat eventually."
Isa: [quiet] "Will he?"
```

### Confrontation

```
Riley: "We need to talk."
Kyr4n: "About?"
Isa: "About this. Us. Whatever's happening."
Kyr4n: "Nothing's happening."
Riley: "Don't do that."
Kyr4n: "Do what?"
Riley: "Pretend everything's fine when it's clearly not."
Kyr4n: "I don't know what you want from me."
Isa: "We want you to talk to us."
Kyr4n: "I am talking."
Isa: "No. You're deflecting. There's a difference."
