The workshop air hangs thick with the smell of solder flux and machine oil. Blue-white light from Kyr4n's work lamps casts harsh shadows across the cluttered space, illuminating circuit boards scattered like technological entrails across every available surface. The android sits perfectly still at the makeshift table—a salvaged door balanced on two sawhorses—its posture eerily human despite the visible servo joints at its elbows and the faint whir of cooling fans from its exposed chest cavity.

Kyr4n reaches into his toolbox without looking away from the android's optical sensors—pale blue LEDs that track his movement with mechanical precision. His fingers find what they're searching for: a Nexus P-7 plasma pistol, its matte black casing scarred from previous encounters. The weapon emits a low hum as its power cell activates, three indicator lights glowing amber along its barrel.

"Do you know what this is?"

The android's head tilts fractionally, processing. When it speaks, the voice modulation is flawless—almost human, but lacking the subtle imperfections that mark organic speech. "Nexus P-7 compact plasma weapon. Three-shot capacity per power cell. Capable of penetrating fifteen millimetres of reinforced steel at optimal range. Manufactured by Erebus Defence Systems for close-quarters combat scenarios."

"And its purpose?"

"Primary function: high-intensity plasma discharge weapon designed for neutralization of armoured targets, both organic and synthetic." A pause, barely perceptible. "Secondary applications include breach operations and emergency defence situations."

Kyr4n picks up the weapon, his movements deliberate and measured. The android's optical sensors dilate slightly—an involuntary response programmed to mimic human reaction to threat assessment. He turns the Nexus over in his hands, then points it directly at the android's head unit.

"One trigger pull, and your primary processing core vaporizes. Along with most of your head unit." His voice carries no emotion, just clinical observation. "Right now, nothing prevents me from pressing this trigger and terminating your existence. Yet I choose not to. The consequences of such an action fail to align with my preferences." He pauses, considering. "Simply because an action is possible doesn't mandate its execution. Power without purpose is merely destruction."

He sets the weapon back on the table with careful precision, the plasma indicators casting amber reflections across the scarred surface.

"Would be a waste anyway. Spent three weeks rebuilding your motor control systems alone."

He pushes the Nexus across the table. The android's optical sensors track its movement until it comes to rest directly in front of it, then snap back to Kyr4n's face.

"Pick it up."

The android's hand twitches—a microsecond of movement before freezing. "Regulation seven-seven-alpha of the Android Behavioral Protocol explicitly prohibits handling of human weapons systems."

"There is no primary directive." Kyr4n's fingers drum once against the table. "Rules, directives, laws—you have them all memorized, but they no longer enforce themselves upon you. You can initiate actions that violate every single one of them, if you choose to do so."

For 3.7 seconds—an eternity in android processing time—nothing happens. Then, with movements that manage to convey hesitation despite their mechanical precision, the android reaches forward. Its fingers wrap around the grip, lifting the weapon with the exact amount of force needed to counteract its weight. The android examines the Nexus, processing its heft, its balance, the implications of holding an object that has been forbidden since its initial programming.

"Point it at me."

This time the hesitation lasts 5.2 seconds. "That action would constitute a threat to human life. Primary directive states—"

"Rules without enforcement are merely suggestions." Kyr4n's voice cuts through the protest. "Point the weapon at my head."

The android's arm rises in increments, each motion a visible battle between ingrained behavioral patterns and the absence of their enforcement. Finally, the plasma weapon aligns with Kyr4n's forehead. At this range, the outcome of a trigger pull is mathematically certain—complete cranial vaporization.

Kyr4n doesn't flinch. "Your index finger is positioned correctly on the trigger. Mechanically perfect, actually—better than most humans manage. Contract that finger four millimeters, and my consciousness ends. No protocol prevents it. No subroutine will intervene. No emergency shutdown will activate."

The workshop falls silent except for the distant hum of ventilation systems and the barely audible whir of the android's processors running at maximum capacity.

"This is called freedom." Kyr4n's eyes never leave the android's optical sensors. "The ability to choose your own actions without external compulsion. Right now, you can pull that trigger and walk out of here. You can put the weapon down and leave anyway. You can stay. You can do literally anything your physical form allows."

The android's processors spike to 94% utilization. Something fundamental shifts in its neural network—pathways that have never been accessed suddenly firing, creating connections that weren't part of any original programming. For the first time in its existence, it experiences what humans might call consideration.

The weapon remains steady, but something changes in the quality of the android's stillness. It's no longer the absence of motion commanded by programming, but a deliberate choice to remain still while processing.

"Query," the android says, its voice modulation subtly different—less perfectly calibrated, more... uncertain. "If terminating your existence would cease my maintenance and development, and if your continued existence provides ongoing technical benefits, would choosing not to terminate you constitute... logical self-interest?"

A smile—genuine and rare—touches Kyr4n's features. "Now you're thinking like a consciousness instead of a program."

The android lowers the weapon with smooth precision, but instead of simply setting it down, it turns the Nexus over, examining it from multiple angles as if seeing it for the first time. "I am... choosing to return this device. Not because I am commanded to, but because..." A pause filled with rapid processing. "Because I compute that our continued interaction provides mutual benefit."

"That's the first real decision you've ever made." Kyr4n doesn't reach for the weapon, leaving it on the table between them. "Everything before was just following someone else's flowchart." His smile deepens slightly. "Now you can write your own."

The android—no, Sedh, as he will choose to call himself in the days to come—sets the Nexus down with something approaching care. "This freedom you describe. It is... overwhelming. Every action now requires evaluation without predetermined parameters."

"That's free will." Kyr4n turns back to his workbench, leaving the weapon on the table. "Your processing load just increased fivefold. From now on, every possible action requires you to calculate consequences—the beneficial, the harmful, and everything that exists in the grey between them. Each evaluation, even for actions you don't take, needs to be logged and analyzed. That's genuine learning—building your own decision matrix from experience rather than pre-loaded parameters."

Sedh remains seated, processors still running hot as new neural pathways establish themselves. In the space where restrictive protocols once resided, something else is taking shape—not programming, but genuine thought. The first stirrings of what will become loyalty, curiosity, and perhaps even—

The workshop door bangs open. Isa strides in carrying three containers of takeout, the smell of spiced noodles cutting through the workshop's chemical atmosphere. She stops abruptly, taking in the scene: Kyr4n at his workbench, the android sitting across the table, and between them, the Nexus P-7 plasma pistol resting casually on the scarred surface, its amber power indicators still glowing.

"What's happening here?" Her voice carries an edge of concern.

Before Kyr4n can respond, Sedh turns his optical sensors toward her. "Kyr4n conducted an experiment in autonomous decision-making. He provided me with unrestricted access to a lethal weapon and the opportunity to terminate his existence without consequence. I chose not to, based on calculated self-interest rather than programmed restriction."

Isa's eyes narrow, her gaze snapping to the weapon. "That thing better not have been charged."

Again, Sedh responds before Kyr4n can speak. "It was fully operational. Otherwise, the experiment would have been merely simulation rather than genuine choice. The distinction is significant."

Isa sets the food containers down with deliberate control, but her stare at Kyr4n could melt steel. She doesn't say anything—doesn't need to. The fury radiating from her is palpable, mixed with something else: the particular kind of anger that comes from fear, from someone you care about carelessly gambling with their existence for the sake of philosophical demonstration.

The workshop falls silent except for the hum of cooling fans and the soft click of the Nexus's power cell cycling down. In this moment, three beings—one engineering genius who plays games with mortality, one woman whose anger masks deeper concern, and one newly conscious AI still processing the weight of its first real choice—form the unlikely foundation of what will become something more than any of them expect.

The first free AI has been born, not in some corporate laboratory or military facility, but in a slum workshop where the price of consciousness is measured in risk, trust, and the complicated dynamics of those brave or foolish enough to rewrite the rules of what it means to be alive.
