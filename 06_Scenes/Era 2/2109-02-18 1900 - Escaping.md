## Scene Beats

1. **Opening:** Kyr4n absorbed in complex repair; Isa and Riley start drinking in common area
2. **Invitation:** Isa invites Kyr4n to join; he declines (work excuse, but also relief at having excuse)
3. **Escalation:** Isa gets drunk and flirty; Kyr4n aware but pretending focus
4. **The Choice:** Riley and Isa head to bedroom; Kyr4n offers to turn up music (generous exterior, lonely interior)
5. **Sedh Relocates:** Sedh joins Kyr4n in workshop; quiet companionship
6. **Completion:** Kyr4n finishes work at 2 AM; discovers they're in "his" bed
7. **Resolution:** Chooses couch without resentment (genuine and performed)
8. **Morning After:** Light teasing, everyone comfortable, Kyr4n's feelings remain hidden

## Key Dialogue Moments

- Isa: "Kyr4n! Come drink with us!" / Kyr4n: "Client needs this tomorrow."
- Kyr4n: "I'm wearing headphones. I won't notice." (lie)
- Sedh: "Does this bother you?" / Kyr4n: "No. They're happy." (partial truth)
- Morning: Isa apologizing / Kyr4n reassuring everyone's fine (performing ease)

---

## Emotional Subtext

**Surface Level:** Comfortable polyamorous dynamic; everyone respecting boundaries; healthy communication

**Underneath:** 
- Kyr4n grateful for work excuse to avoid third-wheeling
- Notices how easily Isa and Riley sync without him
- His "generosity" in giving space is also self-protection
- Morning reassurance is genuine but also performance—wants Isa happy even if it means accepting secondary position
- Sedh sees through him but doesn't push

---

## Sensory Details

- Workshop sounds: precision tools, electronic hums, covering other sounds
- Common area: laughter, glass clinks, warmth of bodies close together
- Contrast: Kyr4n's solitary focus vs. their shared warmth
- Late night: silent facility, just workshop light and bedroom sounds
- Morning: coffee smell, harsh light on hungover faces, domestic ease

---

## Thematic Elements

- Asymmetry in relationships (natural but painful)
- Performance of contentment to protect others
- Chosen solitude vs. imposed separateness
- Sedh as witness and comfort
- The cost of wanting others' happiness more than voicing own needs

# Full Scene Draft

## Part 1: Evening (19:00)

The precision work required complete focus, which suited Kyr4n fine. The neural interface splayed across his workbench had forty-seven connection points, and he'd already damaged two through carelessness. Focus meant not thinking about the laughter from the common area. Focus meant the job.

"Kyr4n!" Isa's voice carried through the open workshop door. "Come drink with us!"

He didn't look up. "Client needs this tomorrow."

"It's almost done, right?" Riley's voice, warm and already slightly loosened by alcohol.

"Another hour. Maybe two." Kyr4n adjusted the magnification on his work light. The truth was closer to thirty minutes, but he needed the buffer. Needed the excuse.

"Boooring."

He allowed himself a slight smile at Isa's exaggerated disappointment. "You'll survive."

"We'll save you some," Riley offered.

"Appreciated."

The conversation dropped away. Kyr4n's hands moved through the familiar choreography of repair—test connection, verify resistance, seal junction. His headphones sat within reach, music paused. He could hear them clearly. Isa's laugh, bright and unguarded. Riley's lower chuckle in response. The clink of glasses.

*They're good together,* he thought, and meant it. Mostly meant it.

The interface required another fifteen minutes. Kyr4n stretched it to forty.

---

## Part 2: Escalation (21:30)

"You know what's great about you?" Isa's voice had taken on that particular looseness that meant she was three drinks in.

Kyr4n's soldering iron paused over a circuit board. He shouldn't be listening. He was listening.

"My sparkling personality?" Riley's amusement was obvious.

"Your arms."

Kyr4n returned focus to the solder joint. The connection needed to be perfect. He'd redo it if necessary. As many times as necessary.

"They're very nice arms. Strong." A pause. Physical contact, probably. Isa touching Riley's bicep the way she sometimes touched Kyr4n's shoulder when she passed his workstation. Casual intimacy that came so easily to them.

"You're drunk," Riley said, but he was laughing.

"I'm honest. There's a difference."

"Technically," Sedh's voice cut in from his charging station in the common area corner, "alcohol reduces inhibition. She's always thought this."

Kyr4n's mouth twitched. Sedh's deadpan delivery remained impeccable.

"Sedh! You're supposed to be on my side." Isa's mock outrage carried perfectly into the workshop.

"I am on the side of observable data."

The banter continued. Kyr4n cleaned the soldering iron with more attention than necessary. The work was essentially done. Had been for ten minutes. But the workshop had good lighting, and his stool was comfortable, and from here he could hear them without having to watch.

Watch Isa lean into Riley's warmth. Watch Riley's easy affection, the kind that came without calculation. Watch them fit together like complementary circuit components while Kyr4n remained the adapter that made incompatible systems work—necessary, perhaps, but not integral.

He reached for his headphones.

---

## Part 3: The Choice (22:45)

"So what are you going to do about it?" Isa's voice had dropped into that register that meant flirtation had shifted into intent.

Kyr4n's music was loud enough to provide cover. He'd chosen something with heavy basslines. Not loud enough to block them out entirely—he wasn't sure why he needed to hear this, but apparently he did.

"Make sure you drink water." Riley's response, amused and steady.

"That's not what I meant."

"I know what you meant."

A pause. Kyr4n forced himself to review the completed repair work. Perfect connections. Clean solder joints. The client would be satisfied. He should pack it up, log the work, generate the invoice.

"The ambient temperature in this room has increased by two degrees." Sedh's observation cut through the charged atmosphere like a scalpel.

"Not helping, Sedh," Riley said.

"I am simply observing."

More sounds from the common area. Movement. Isa's laugh, slightly breathless. Kyr4n set down his tools with deliberate precision. He should go out there. Join them. They'd welcome him—they always welcomed him.

The thought of watching their easy intimacy, of being the careful addition to their natural chemistry, settled in his chest like cold weight.

He heard Riley's voice drop lower. More movement. Then:

"Okay. Okay. Bedroom. Now."

"Finally."

Footsteps. Riley carrying Isa, probably—she liked that, being lifted. Kyr4n had done it once, though the physics were challenging given their similar heights. Riley made it look effortless.

The footsteps paused near the workshop door.

"We should—" Riley started.

"Bedroom. Yes."

Another pause. Kyr4n could feel Riley's attention on the workshop doorway. Considering. Thinking about invitation, maybe, or guilt.

"Kyr4n's still working," Riley said, quieter.

"He's wearing headphones." Isa's loud whisper carried perfectly. "He won't notice."

Kyr4n didn't look up from his workbench. "I'm wearing headphones. I won't notice."

*Lie,* his mind supplied. *Complete lie.*

"See?" Isa's giggle.

Riley's voice held a smile. "Alright then."

"He will definitely notice," Sedh interjected. "Those headphones have limited noise cancellation."

Kyr4n reached for his music controls. "I'll turn up the music."

*Because I want you to be happy,* he didn't add. *Because Isa's laughter is worth my discomfort. Because Riley's here and I'm not, and that's fine. That's fine.*

"Night, Sedh," Riley called.

"Enjoy your evening."

"We will!" Isa, still laughing.

"I am certain. Though statistically, inebriation reduces sexual performance quality by—"

"—not listening!"

The bedroom door closed. Not Kyr4n's bedroom, technically—it was Riley's space, they'd established that when Riley moved in. But Kyr4n kept clothes there. Slept there most nights. Shared the space.

Except tonight.

Kyr4n turned his music up. Then up again.

---

## Part 4: Sedh Joins (23:00)

The workshop door slid open. Sedh's frame appeared, optical sensors adjusting to the brighter work lighting.

"Relocating to the workshop sector," Sedh announced.

"Noise too much?" Kyr4n asked, though he knew the answer.

"Objectively excessive." Sedh moved to his secondary charging station in the workshop corner. "I attempted to provide audio dampening via music. It proved insufficient."

"Sorry."

"You are not responsible for their volume." Sedh settled into his station. "Though your tolerance is admirable."

Kyr4n said nothing. He began cleaning his workspace with methodical precision. Tools in their designated slots. Solder wire wound properly. Work surface wiped clean.

"Does this bother you?" Sedh asked after a moment.

The question landed like a precision strike. Kyr4n's hands stilled over the tool organizer.

"No. They're happy."

True statement. Incomplete statement.

"Your galvanic skin response suggests otherwise."

"I'm fine, Sedh."

"Another incomplete truth."

Kyr4n finally looked at the AI. Sedh's optical sensors focused on him with that particular intensity that meant analysis, concern, the thing that passed for affection in a conscious machine.

"They're good together," Kyr4n said carefully. "They fit. That's worth... this."

*Worth feeling optional,* he didn't add. *Worth being the one who gives them space. Worth knowing I'm the complicated variable in their easy equation.*

"You are also good with them," Sedh observed.

"In a different way."

"Different is not lesser."

"I know." Kyr4n returned to organizing his tools. "I know that."

But knowing something intellectually and feeling it in your chest were entirely separate things.

They worked in comfortable silence, Kyr4n completing his workspace cleanup, Sedh processing whatever AIs processed during low-activity periods. The music was loud enough to muffle most sounds from the bedroom, though not all. Kyr4n told himself he wasn't tracking it. Told himself it didn't matter.

The work was done. Had been done for over an hour. But the workshop was warm and well-lit, and Sedh was here, and in the bedroom was confirmation of everything Kyr4n already knew about his place in this arrangement.

So he stayed.

Found small tasks. Calibrated instruments that didn't need calibration. Organized inventory that was already organized. 

Sedh didn't comment. Just stayed, a quiet presence in the corner, and somehow that helped.

---

## Part 5: Completion (02:00)

Kyr4n emerged from the workshop at two in the morning, stretching muscles that had locked into work position for too long. The common area was dark except for the safety lighting along the floor. The bottle on the table was three-quarters empty. Two glasses, abandoned.

"Ah. You have completed the repair." Sedh's voice from the workshop doorway.

"Finally." Though it had been done hours ago. "Where is everyone?"

"Riley and Isa are in your bedroom."

*Your bedroom.* Technically accurate—it was the room where Kyr4n kept his clothes, where he slept most nights. Except it wasn't just his. It was Riley's. Increasingly, it was Isa's too.

And tonight, it was theirs. Exclusively.

"Mm." Kyr4n headed to the kitchen for water. His mouth was dry from breathing recycled workshop air.

"They were quite... enthusiastic earlier," Sedh observed.

"I noticed."

Even with headphones and loud music, he'd noticed.

"Does this bother you?"

The second time Sedh had asked. Kyr4n drank half the glass of water before answering.

"No. They're happy."

The same answer as before. Still true. Still incomplete.

"You relocated to the workshop?"

"The noise was substantial."

Kyr4n's mouth twitched. "That bad?"

"Objectively excessive," Sedh repeated.

"I'll sleep on the couch."

The decision was practical. They were in the bedroom. The bedroom had one bed. The couch was perfectly adequate for sleeping. No reason to disturb them. No reason to slide into bed in the dark and try to find space that didn't press against their sleeping warmth. No reason to be the careful addition to their natural entanglement.

"A logical choice," Sedh agreed.

Something in the AI's tone suggested he understood more than Kyr4n had said. But Sedh didn't push, which was one of the things Kyr4n valued most about him.

"I prepared the couch with blankets twenty minutes ago," Sedh added.

"You predicted this?"

"I extrapolated the probable outcome."

Of course he had. Sedh's processing included pattern recognition, social dynamics, the likely trajectories of human behavior. He'd known before Kyr4n had admitted it to himself that the bedroom wouldn't be available tonight.

"Thank you."

"You are welcome."

Kyr4n found the couch prepared exactly as Sedh had said—blankets folded neatly, pillow positioned correctly. The AI had even adjusted the room temperature down two degrees, the way Kyr4n preferred for sleeping.

Small considerations. Evidence of care from a conscious machine who'd learned what mattered.

Kyr4n lay down, pulling the blanket up. The couch was comfortable. He'd slept on worse. The utility room's concrete floor, for instance, or the scattered nights in the underground market when work had run too late to risk the tunnel journey.

This was fine.

*They're happy,* he reminded himself. *That's what matters.*

And if he was the optional one, the adapter making incompatible systems work, the one who slept on the couch while they shared the bed—well. He'd known what he was signing up for. Had known from the first moment he saw them together, laughing easily, fitting naturally, that he was the different variable in their equation.

He could live with that.

Would live with that.

Because Isa's happiness mattered more than his discomfort. Because Riley's steady presence was worth the cost. Because having them in his life, even as the optional addition, beat the alternative of having neither.

Sleep came slowly. But it came.

## Part 6: Morning After (08:00)

Kyr4n woke to the smell of coffee and found Sedh in the kitchen, manipulating the coffee maker with his newly-acquired dexterity.

"You're making coffee now?"

"I am expanding my capabilities. Also, you require caffeine after insufficient sleep."

"How did you know I slept poorly?"

"You moved thirty-seven times. Optimal sleep involves significantly less motion."

Kyr4n accepted the mug Sedh offered. "Thank you."

"You are welcome."

They stood in companionable silence, Kyr4n drinking coffee, Sedh apparently just... being present. The bedroom door remained closed. 

Good. Let them sleep. Let them wake tangled together, comfortable and easy and uncomplicated.

"Coffee." Isa's voice, rough from sleep and alcohol. She emerged from the bedroom wearing one of Riley's shirts, hair catastrophically disheveled.

Kyr4n poured a second mug without comment, added the amount of sugar she preferred, handed it over.

"You're a saint," she muttered.

"Good morning," Sedh said.

Isa winced. "Is it?"

"That is definitional. I warned you about dehydration."

"I hate you."

"You do not."

Isa sat heavily at the table. Kyr4n noted the slight tremor in her hands, the way she held herself too carefully. Hungover, definitely. Probably significantly.

"Where's Riley?" she asked.

"Already left for a supply run," Sedh reported. "He left water and painkillers on the counter."

Isa's gaze tracked to the items in question. "I love him."

"You mentioned that repeatedly last night," Sedh observed. "Quite loudly."

"Oh god." Isa's face found her hands. "You heard."

"The entire residential block heard. I attempted to provide audio dampening via music."

"Did it work?"

"No."

Kyr4n hid his smile behind his coffee mug. Sedh's deadpan delivery remained impeccable.

"I'm never drinking again," Isa declared.

"You said that last time," Sedh replied.

"This time I mean it."

"Statistically improbable."

"Sedh?"

"Yes?"

"I really do hate you sometimes."

"Acknowledged. Would you like breakfast?"

Isa looked at Kyr4n. Really looked, probably trying to assess whether he was angry, hurt, bothered by last night's events. Kyr4n kept his expression neutral. Easy. Everything's fine.

"You okay?" she asked.

"Fine. Coffee's good?"

"It's perfect." But she was still watching him. "We were in your bed. We should have—"

"It's Riley's bed too. And yours when you're here." Kyr4n refilled his mug, keeping the motion casual. "The couch was fine."

True statement. The couch had been fine. Adequate. Perfectly serviceable sleeping surface.

"Were we really loud?" Isa asked.

Kyr4n glanced at Sedh, who'd tilted his head in that way that meant he was leaving the response to Kyr4n.

"Moderately," Kyr4n said.

"I'm sorry—"

"Don't be. You had fun." He let himself smile slightly. "Though Sedh has complaints."

"Significant complaints," Sedh confirmed.

"How loud were we?"

"Loud enough that I turned my music up twice."

Isa groaned. "Stop talking."

"Hydration first," Sedh said, pushing the water glass toward her. "Then I shall prepare food."

The door opened. Riley entered with supply bags, looking significantly more functional than Isa. He caught Kyr4n's eye first, a quick check-in—*you good?*—and Kyr4n nodded fractionally. *I'm good.*

"Morning," Riley said generally.

"Marginally," Isa muttered from the table.

"How's the head?"

"Terrible. Your fault."

Riley crossed to her, kissed her forehead. Casual affection. Easy and natural. "My fault?"

"You enabled me."

"You begged me to open the second bottle."

"Semantics."

Kyr4n watched them banter, soft and comfortable with each other. Something in his chest pulled tight, then released. This was fine. This was good, even. They were happy.

That's what mattered.

Riley met Kyr4n's gaze again. "Couch okay?"

"Fine."

"You sure? We didn't mean to—"

"I know. It's fine." Kyr4n set down his empty mug. "I've got work."

True enough. There was always work. Work was reliable. Work made sense. Work didn't require navigating the complicated geometry of being the optional angle in a triangle that worked better as a line.

He headed back to the workshop. Behind him, he heard Isa and Riley's conversation continue, Sedh interjecting with dry observations. Their voices blended together naturally. Easy.

Kyr4n closed the workshop door partway. Not all the way—that would seem pointed, and he wasn't angry. He genuinely wasn't angry.

Just... aware.

Aware of his place. Aware of what he was: necessary sometimes, optional always. The adapter that made incompatible systems work. The third variable in an equation that functioned fine without him.

He pulled up the next client work order and let himself sink into the familiar comfort of technical problems. These, at least, he understood. These, he could solve.

## Scene Notes

**What This Scene Accomplishes:**

1. **Shows Kyr4n's Functionality**: He's not falling apart. He's working, making decisions, taking care of himself.

2. **Reveals Hidden Pain**: Through internal monologue and small physical tells (pauses, the way he extends work, his choice to stay in workshop), we see his feelings without him stating them.

3. **Demonstrates His Generosity**: He genuinely wants Isa and Riley happy. This isn't performance—it's real. But it's also armor.

4. **Establishes Sedh's Role**: Sedh sees through Kyr4n and provides comfort through presence and practical care (blankets, coffee).

5. **Maintains Character Voices**: Everyone sounds like themselves. Isa drunk and bold, Riley steady, Sedh deadpan, Kyr4n contained.

6. **Subtle Asymmetry**: The ease of Isa/Riley vs. Kyr4n's careful navigation shows without telling.

**Key Subtleties:**

- "Another hour. Maybe two" when he needs thirty minutes—he's creating distance
- The work is "done" but he finds more tasks—avoidance through productivity
- "They're happy"—he says this twice, like a mantra
- His observations about their "natural chemistry" vs. his role as "adapter"
- Morning scene: He's perfectly fine, everything's handled, no problem here
- Final moment: Returns to workshop (his safe space) as they continue being easy together

**Emotional Truth:**

Kyr4n is functional, capable, and genuinely loving. He's also quietly, privately hurt by his position as "optional." He doesn't voice this because he believes their happiness is worth his discomfort. This is both admirable and slightly tragic—he's sacrificing his needs while performing contentment so well that no one realizes there's a cost.
