# Concept — Waking Up

## Prompt
ROLE: Story Architect

Analyze the following scene concept.

## Required Inputs
- POV character: [[Kyr4n]]
- Location: Neo-Montreal, South Shore industrial market
- Time: Early evening, just before curfew
- Characters present: Kyr4n, Isa (observing), background vendors and scavengers
- Previous scene: Kyr4n finishes a risky implant repair job
- Next scene: Kyr4n becomes aware he’s being watched

---

## Scene Purpose
Establish Kyr4n’s growing unease as his technical confidence clashes with environmental threat.  
This scene should subtly reintroduce Isa as a hidden presence without confirming her intentions.

---

## Emotional Arc
Controlled → distracted → uneasy → quietly threatened

---

## What Must Change by the End
Kyr4n goes from feeling in control of his surroundings to sensing that something external is tracking or testing him.

---

## Constraints (Must NOT Happen)
- No direct confrontation
- No explicit recognition of Isa
- No violence
- No exposition about past relationship
- No internal monologue explaining fear directly

---

## Thematic Notes
- Surveillance as atmosphere rather than action  
- Public space that feels narrow and monitored  
- Technology as both comfort and vulnerability


OUTPUT:
1. Scene purpose (1–2 sentences)
2. Emotional arc (start → end)
3. What must change by the end
4. Constraints (what must NOT happen)

RULES:
- No prose
- No dialogue

 is the scene analysis per requirements:

1.  **Scene Purpose:** Establish Kyr4n's technical confidence contrasted with encroaching vulnerability, reintroducing Isa as a subtle atmospheric threat through heightened paranoia without explicit confirmation.
2.  **Emotional Arc:** Confident control (technical mastery) → Distracted dissonance (background noise/intuition) → Undefined unease → Quietly threatened (sensed observation).
3.  **What Must Change:** Kyr4n transitions from feeling focused and in command of his environment (post-job satisfaction) to acutely sensing an external, unseen presence observing/testing him, undermining his sense of control and safety.
4.  **Constraints (Must NOT Hap
