## Layout

### Exterior Overview

Nestled on the south-eastern outskirts of the South Shore Slum, the **Phoenix Recovery** compound stands as a modest but defiant outpost amid the sprawling chaos of container stacks and scrapyard dunes. Three weathered shipping containers—former industrial haulers marked with faded logos like "MAERSK" and "COSCO"—are arranged in a tight L-shape on a cleared patch of cracked concrete, partially shielded by a chain-link fence topped with razor wire.

The containers are welded together at their joining walls, with reinforced metal patches and external conduits snaking across their corrugated steel surfaces like mechanical veins. A small gravel path leads to the main entrance on the left container, where a hand-painted sign glows softly: "Phoenix Recovery" in stylized orange-red letters with a subtle phoenix emblem, illuminated by hidden LED strips that flicker faintly in the perpetual slum haze.

The air around the compound carries the distant hum of the slum—generator drones, muffled voices from nearby stacks, and the occasional roar of a passing scavenged vehicle. At night, the exterior LEDs cast a warm amber glow, making the place feel like a beacon of quiet reliability amid the toxic fog and acid-rain streaks that mar the metal walls. Rain patters rhythmically on the roofs, and the scent of ozone from nearby electronics mixes with the earthy dampness of the outskirts.

### Layout and Connections

The three containers form an integrated complex:

- **Left Container**: Public-facing entrance and customer area.
- **Center Container**: Core workshop space, fully joined to the rear of the left via a wide internal opening (adjoining wall removed and reinforced with steel beams).
- **Right Container**: Private living and administrative space, connected to the center workshop via a secure internal door.

All lighting is exclusively LED—strips embedded in ceilings, walls, and work surfaces, fully dimmable via central controls or voice commands (tied to Sedh's systems). The ambiance shifts from bright clinical white for precision work to warm amber for evenings, or cool blue for late-night focus. Power hums softly from concealed batteries and solar scavenges on the roofs, ensuring the space never goes dark.

Narrow external walkways and a small covered patio area between the L-shape provide outdoor workspace for larger items, with tool racks and a welding station sheltered under corrugated overhangs.

### Left Container: Customer Service Area

The main door—a heavy reinforced steel slab with biometric locks and a small viewport—opens into the front third of the left container, creating a welcoming yet secure reception space. The air here is cleaner, filtered through discreet vents, carrying faint scents of solder and coffee.

A polished counter (salvaged composite with embedded holographic display) runs along one wall, equipped with a register terminal, payment scanner, and sample display cases under glass—gleaming neural interfaces and repaired devices showcased like jewelry. Two sturdy chairs face the counter for clients, with a low table holding tech magazines and a water dispenser.

Soft, dimmable LED panels overhead provide warm welcoming light, adjustable to highlight products or create privacy during discrete consultations. Behind the counter, a reinforced metal wall (welded steel plates with hidden sensors) separates the public area from the workshop. A heavy door in this wall—locked and monitored—leads to the heart of the operation, buzzing open only for trusted clients or staff.

The space feels professional yet intimate: walls lined with organized parts bins and subtle phoenix decals, the faint whir of cooling fans, and the occasional ping of incoming messages.

### Center + Rear Left Container: Main Workshop

Passing through the reinforced door reveals the expansive main workshop—a seamless fusion of the center container and the rear two-thirds of the left one. The open space stretches long and functional, filled with the organized chaos of a master artisan's domain.

Multiple workbenches line the walls: molecular-level repair stations in nitrogen-filled chambers glowing softly under focused LEDs, precision CNC machines humming in one corner, 3D printers whirring with multi-material builds, and traditional machining tools (lathes, mills) in another. Shelves overflow with components—circuit boards, neural cables, quantum storage drives—lit by dimmable strips that can spotlight a single workbench or flood the room in bright white for detailed work.

Along the far back wall, opposite the entry from the customer area, sits a large, battered old couch—scavenged from some pre-collapse office, its dark faux-leather cracked and patched with duct tape, cushions permanently indented from years of use. It’s pushed against the corrugated wall, piled with spare blankets and a few worn pillows, serving as an impromptu break area where Kyr4n, Riley, or Isa collapse after long sessions. The couch faces the workshop, offering a view of the glowing benches—a place to watch work in progress, share quiet conversations, or simply rest while staying close to the tools.

The air is thick with the metallic tang of solder, ozone from electronics, and faint chemical notes from fabrication. Fans whisper constantly, maintaining contaminant-free zones. Sedh's interface terminal dominates one wall—a holographic display for diagnostics—while tool racks and diagnostic equipment create shadowed alcoves.

At night, dimmed amber LEDs cast long shadows across the couch, turning the space into a cavern of glowing screens and flickering solder irons, where Kyr4n's focused silhouette often hunches over impossible repairs—or sprawls exhausted on the worn cushions.

### Right Container: Private Quarters and Admin Office

Connected via a discreet internal door from the workshop (often left ajar for easy access), the right container splits neatly into two halves.

**Front Half: Admin Office**  
Isa’s domain—a compact but efficient office with a large desk facing holographic monitors, filing systems for client records (encrypted drives), and communication arrays. Shelves hold business ledgers, parts inventories, and a small coffee station. Dimmable LEDs provide crisp task lighting over the desk, shifting to softer tones for planning sessions. The air is warmer here, with subtle floral notes from Isa's touches—a few resilient plants under grow lights.

**Rear Half: Bedroom**  
Home to Kyr4n and Riley, this cozy space is separated from the main workshop by a makeshift partition: tall sheets of scavenged tin and dense foam panels, bolted together into a folding screen-like wall that runs floor-to-ceiling but offers no real soundproofing. Workshop hums, solder pops, and late-night tool clanks filter through easily—privacy is visual only, a gentle boundary in a shared life.

Behind the partition, one large platform bed is built into the end wall, layered with scavenged but comfortable bedding. Storage drawers underneath hold personal items, while wall-mounted LEDs create intimate dim glows—cool blues for rest, warm ambers for late-night conversations.

A small seating nook with cushions and a low table allows for quiet moments; personal artifacts like Kyr4n's mother's journal or Riley's meditation stones add warmth. Privacy curtains can further section off the bed when needed. The scent is lived-in: faint electronics bleeding through the partition, mixed with clean linens and occasional perfume when Isa visits.

### Atmosphere and Sensory Details

Phoenix Recovery feels like a sanctuary of controlled precision in the slum's entropy—yet with lived-in edges: the sagging couch bearing witness to exhausted collapses, the thin tin-foam partition reminding that true separation is rare here. The constant low hum of equipment, adjustable LED glows shifting with mood or task, and layered scents (dust, solder, coffee, faint human warmth) create an immersive haven.

Public areas project quiet professionalism; private spaces offer rare intimacy and rest, blurred by the open flow of sound and light. Rain drums on roofs during storms, wind rattles external conduits, but inside, dimmed lights and filtered air provide respite—while the workshop's heartbeat leaks through the partition, tying work and life inseparably together.

It's a place where broken things—and people—find second chances, lit by the soft, adaptable glow of LEDs in a world that rarely offers light.

## Company Origins & History

### Early Operations (2102-2108)

Phoenix Recovery began as Kyr4n's individual repair services at the underground grey markets. Operating from a portable workstation at vendor stalls, Kyr4n built his reputation as "The Artisan" through exceptional technical capabilities that often salvaged electronics others deemed irreparable.

**Foundation Timeline:**

- **2108**: Purchase of the 3 container facility, incorporation as Phoenix Recovery, LLC, with initial capital from Riley and Isa's investments




### Business Growth (2108+)

The transition from market stall to permanent facility marked Phoenix Recovery's evolution into a recognized technical service provider. The three-container complex provides dedicated workspace for precision repairs, fabrication capabilities, and discrete consultation services.
