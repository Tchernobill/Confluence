# Cyberpunk Novel Scene Crafting Prompt

## Primary Directive

Draft a scene based on the provided scene summary document while maintaining perfect consistency with established narrative elements, character voices, and world-building details.

## Required Context Documents

Before writing, review and integrate information from:

### 2. **Narrative Context**

- **Arc Summary Document** (e.g., `Arc 1 - The Scavenger.md`): Overall arc themes, character development goals, and major plot threads
- **Chapter Summary Document** (e.g., `01.01 - The Artisan's World.md`): Chapter-specific mood, pacing, and connection to adjacent chapters

### 3. **Style Foundation**

- **Writing Style Document** (`Style and Themes.md`): Genre conventions, narrative voice, thematic elements, and tonal consistency requirements

### 4. **Character Consistency**
