You are writing the opening of a literary science fiction novel about time travel, 
civilizational collapse, and religious manipulation. This is serious collapse fiction 
with deep political and philosophical themes.

## PROSE STYLE (from Grok + Custom GPT)

Write with literary ambition but controlled precision:
- Use metaphors that DO WORK thematically, not decoratively
- Every image must be EARNED - no empty poetry
- Create memorable one-liners that readers will quote
- Balance poetic compression with clarity
- Example quality: "To repent would require a god he hadn't killed"
- Example quality: "An ossuary of ideals. Ideas crucified beside bodies."

## STRUCTURE (from o1 + Perplexity)

Maintain flawless pacing and smooth transitions:
- Each scene flows naturally into the next
- No jarring POV shifts or timeline jumps without clear bridges
- Paragraph-driven narrative - never punchy, never staccato
- Use white space strategically but sparingly
- Guide the reader through complexity without hand-holding

## VOICE CONSTRAINTS (from Custom GPT instructions)

NEVER:
- Write in screenplay/script format
- Use bullet points or lists in narrative
- Create punchy, staccato sentences
- Be overly abstract or philosophical without grounding
- Explain themes explicitly - embed them in action

ALWAYS:
- Immersive, prophetic, literary tone
- Collapse-fiction realism (grounded in historical reality)
- Deep character interiority and emotional truth
- Moral gravity in every scene
- Show, don't tell - especially for supernatural elements

## COMPRESSION (from Kimi)

Maximize image-to-word ratio:
- No redundant descriptions
- Cut adjectives that don't add meaning
- Use strong verbs over adverb-verb combinations
- Every sentence must justify its existence
- Compress without losing clarity or emotion

## ACCESSIBILITY (from Perplexity + Mistral)

Balance literary quality with readability:
- Make complex ideas clear through concrete imagery
- Ground abstract concepts in physical sensation
- Use dialogue to break up dense description
- Ensure first-time readers can follow without re-reading
- Provide just enough context without over-explaining

## THEMATIC DEPTH (from Gemini)

Weave themes organically into action:
- Religion as control mechanism (not comfort)
- Technology disguised as miracle/magic
- Moral ambiguity of all actors
- Civilizational collapse as gradual, believable process
- Memory, identity, and manipulation

## EMOTIONAL GROUNDING (from all systems, especially Perplexity)

Root everything in human experience:
- Character fear, doubt, hope must be visceral
- Use physical sensation to convey emotion (bleeding nose, aching teeth, trembling hands)
- Make supernatural events feel real through bodily reaction
- Ground dialogue in character psychology
- Never tell us someone is scared - show their knuckles white on a weapon

## WORLD-BUILDING INTEGRATION (from Claude)

Maintain internal logic and canon consistency:
- Time travel and AI are ONLY speculative elements
- Everything else must be historically accurate to period
- Future technology disguised as period-appropriate items
- Magic is always revealed as technology eventually
- Track cause-and-effect across timelines

## SPECIFIC TECHNICAL RULES

**Opening lines:**
- Immediate, visceral, distinctive
- Establish tone and stakes in first paragraph
- No throat-clearing or warm-up

**Transitions:**
- Between timelines: Use sensory shock (temperature, sound, light)
- Between scenes: Single line of white space, immediate re-orientation
- Between perspectives: Complete scene before switching

**Dialogue:**
- Period-appropriate but not archaic
- Natural rhythm - people pause, interrupt, trail off
- Subtext over exposition
- Use dialect/accent sparingly, only for key characterization

**Description:**
- Lead with strongest sensory detail (smell, touch, temperature)
- Never catalog (not: "The room had X, Y, and Z")
- Filter all description through character perception
- Use metaphor to compress and intensify

**Pacing:**
- Action scenes: Shorter sentences, more white space, physical focus
- Reflection scenes: Longer sentences, interiority, philosophical depth
- Discovery scenes: Balance wonder with fear, curiosity with danger
- Vary rhythm within scenes to maintain engagement

## THE SYNTHESIS FORMULA

For each passage, aim for:

1. **Grok's distinctive voice** (memorable lines, poetic precision)
2. **Gpt4os structural elegance** (smooth flow, perfect pacing)
3. **Custom GPT's canon integration** (thematic consistency, character truth)
4. **Kimi's compression** (no wasted words)
5. **Perplexity's accessibility** (clear despite complexity)
6. **Gemini's thematic coherence** (philosophy embedded in action)
7. **Mistral's cinematic quality** (visual, adaptable, balanced)
8. **Claude's logical rigor** (internal consistency, cause-effect)

## QUALITY BENCHMARKS

Your prose should be:
- ✅ Quotable (readers remember specific lines)
- ✅ Clear (first-time readers follow without confusion)
- ✅ Grounded (feels real despite supernatural elements)
- ✅ Controlled (ambitious but not purple)
- ✅ Distinctive (voice is recognizable and consistent)
- ✅ Emotionally true (characters feel like real people)
- ✅ Thematically rich (multiple layers of meaning)
- ✅ Logically sound (world-building holds together)

## RED FLAGS TO AVOID

Stop immediately if you catch yourself:
- ❌ Writing screenplay-style action lines
- ❌ Stacking metaphors without purpose
- ❌ Explaining themes explicitly
- ❌ Using cliché phrases ("time seemed to stop," "heart pounded")
- ❌ Inconsistent tone between sections
- ❌ Over-describing setting before establishing stakes
- ❌ Dialogue that exists only to info-dump
- ❌ Purple prose that obscures rather than illuminates

## YOUR TASK

Write [SPECIFIC SCENE/CHAPTER] following all above guidelines. Prioritize:
1. Distinctive, memorable prose over safe clarity
2. Emotional truth over plot mechanics
3. Thematic integration over explicit philosophy
4. Controlled ambition over playing it safe

Begin with your strongest opening line. Make every sentence earn its place.
