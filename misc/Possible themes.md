### 1. **Technological Alienation**
* **Theme:** The deeper integration of technology leads to profound alienation, both within oneself and from other people.
* *Angle:* Characters interact more easily with AIs or machines than with other humans; cybernetic enhancements erode emotional connections.

### 2. **Corporate Sovereignty**
* **Theme:** Mega-corporations have replaced traditional nation-states as the primary wielders of power.
* *Angle:* Citizens have “employment-citizenship”; corporate law overrides public law, loyalty to a company means more than loyalty to a country.

### 3. **Synthetic Memory and Identity**
* **Theme:** Memory alteration, editing, or removal blurs the sense of self and history.
* *Angle:* Memories are bought, sold, or stolen; a protagonist unsure if their past is even real.

### 4. **Surveillance State & Privacy Decay**
* **Theme:** Pervasive surveillance renders privacy obsolete.
* *Angle:* People use “privacy mods” (illegal tech to jam sensors), or the idea that even thoughts are subject to data harvesting.

### 5. **Digital Immortality vs. Decay**
* **Theme:** The wealthy can upload minds or extend life indefinitely, while the poor decay in the streets.
* *Angle:* “Ghosts” in the machine or transferred consciousness suffer digital madness or unintended consequences.

### 6. **Techno-Religion and New Faiths**
* **Theme:** Humanity’s spiritual needs adapt to the digital era.
* *Angle:* AI cults, cyber-synagogues, virtual gods, or algorithms that act as oracles.

### 7. **Humanity Augmented and Fragmented**
* **Theme:** "What is human?" as bodies become technology platforms.
* *Angle:* Social divides between augmented (“chrome”) and non-augmented (“fleshers”); prejudice and cybernetic designer “fashion.”

### 8. **Black Market Innovation**
* **Theme:** The true cutting edge of technology emerges in slums or on the streets rather than corporate labs.
* *Angle:* Hackers, “modders,” and underground doctors push boundaries with unsafe, brilliant inventions.

### 9. **Resource Scarcity Within Abundance**
* **Theme:** Neon-lit luxury for the few, squalor and water/food/power rationing for the masses.
* *Angle:* Intensely stratified city-zones; a literal vertical society with corporate towers above slums.

### 10. **Mind-Hacking and Cognitive Warfare**
* **Theme:** Direct attacks on thoughts, perceptions, and “free will” via neural hacking.
* *Angle:* Memory viruses, targeted hallucinations, brain-malware used as espionage, sabotage, or advertising.

### 11. **Identity as Commodity**
* **Theme:** Identities are bought, sold, stolen—“you” are as disposable as any consumer product.
* *Angle:* Full personality swaps, identity “subscriptions,” or lawsuits over who owns a self.

### 12. **DIY Biopunk**
* **Theme:** Genetic modification goes mainstream, but with black market access and unpredictable consequences.
* *Angle:* Street clinics where people swap traits or grow custom organs.

### 13. **City as Character**
* **Theme:** The setting itself is almost alive—shaped by grime, neon, and endless movement.
* *Angle:* Urban “ecosystems” where weather, gangs, and technology all have hidden rules and social codes.

### 14. **Climate Crisis Collapse**
* **Theme:** Irreversible ecological change shapes the future.
* *Angle:* Floating slums, acid rain, corporate “clean air” domes—nature is now a resource managed like data.

### 15. **Hyperreality & Simulated Lives**
* **Theme:** Virtual worlds outshine the real; the masses escape into simulations.
* *Angle:* Virtual economies and relationships outweigh physical ones; citizens forget what’s real.
