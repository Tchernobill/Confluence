## Structural Elements

**Arc Opening**: Vyr4n wakes in his concrete utility room hideout, emphasizing his isolation and survival-focused existence. Mood: Gritty, solitary, cyberpunk atmosphere of urban decay.

**Arc Climax**: The confrontation over Sedh's personhood when Isa views him as "just technology" while Vyr4n insists on treating the android as a person with rights and autonomy. This forces a philosophical and emotional reckoning about consciousness, freedom, and relationships.

**Arc Resolution**: Phoenix Recovery officially opens with a line of clients, representing Vyr4n's transformation from isolated scavenger to successful artisan. However, Isa's observation that Vyr4n shows more connection to Sedh than to any human hints at future complications.

**Arc Mood/Tone Evolution**:

- **Opening**: Gritty isolation, survival-focused, cyberpunk dystopia
- **Middle**: Tentative connection, philosophical exploration, growing warmth
- **Ending**: Cautious optimism, legitimate success, but underlying emotional barriers remain

**Transition to Next Arc**: Phoenix Recovery's success and Vyr4n's growing reputation will attract Frank's attention for the corporate heist, while the deep relationships established here will be tested by the viral infection in Arc 2.
