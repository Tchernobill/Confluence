## Notes on Theme Development

1. **Themes Emerge Organically**: They arise from character choices and world circumstances rather than being imposed on the story.

2. **Multiple Perspectives**: Each theme explored through different characters and situations, preventing simplistic answers.

3. **No Easy Resolutions**: Confluence deliberately avoids pat thematic conclusions—complexity and ambiguity maintained.

4. **Character-Driven**: Themes serve character development rather than characters serving themes.

5. **Long-Form Evolution**: Decade-spanning narrative enables genuine thematic transformation rather than quick shifts.

6. **Interconnection**: Themes designed to reinforce and complicate each other rather than existing independently.

7. **Show Don't Tell**: Themes revealed through action, consequence, and character growth rather than explicit statements.
