# THEME FILE — Violence and Its Cycles

## Theme Name
**Theme Name:** Violence and Its Cycles

## Summary
This theme explores how violence—even when deployed with protective or liberating intentions—perpetuates itself through cycles of retaliation, dependency, and escalation. The narrative traces how defensive violence escalates to systematic warfare, demonstrating that overwhelming force doesn't solve underlying conflicts but creates new ones. The theme asks: Can violence ever break cycles of oppression, or does it only replace one oppressor with another? When does protection through violence become indistinguishable from oppression? Is there a path beyond endless warfare?

## Emotional Function
This theme generates moral tension between satisfaction at seeing oppressors punished and horror at recognizing violence's perpetuation of suffering. It creates frustration watching characters trapped in escalating cycles, relief when violence proves effective for immediate protection, and grief at long-term costs. The theme evokes the exhausting nature of endless conflict and the hope that choosing non-violence might break seemingly inevitable patterns. It forces examination of how easily protective instincts justify brutality and how violence becomes normalized through repetition.
