## Notes on Technology Integration

The technological landscape represents a world where corporate research has created advanced systems, but economic collapse has made these technologies available through underground markets and salvage operations. The result is a complex ecosystem where military-grade nanobots can exist alongside improvised repair equipment, and conscious AIs work alongside augmented humans using salvaged components.

The key to understanding this world's technology is recognizing that advancement and degradation exist simultaneously—breakthrough consciousness research happens in underground workshops, while corporate facilities develop weapons of psychological warfare. Technology serves both liberation and oppression, often simultaneously.
