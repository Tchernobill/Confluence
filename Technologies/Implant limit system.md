I'll help you develop a compelling implant limitation system for your cyberpunk novel. Let me first check your project files to understand your existing world-building.

Excellent question! Based on your existing enhancement documentation, I can see you already have a solid foundation with cost barriers and side effects. Let me suggest a comprehensive limitation system that would create realistic barriers to widespread enhancement:

## **Biocompatibility Degradation System**

Yes, degradation from organic contact is a brilliant limitation! Here's how to systematize it:

**Organic Rejection Cascade**: All non-premium implants gradually corrode when exposed to:
- **Blood pH fluctuations** - Human biochemistry constantly attacks foreign materials
- **Immune system erosion** - White blood cells slowly break down synthetic components
- **Protein buildup** - Organic tissues form scar tissue that interferes with connections
- **Oxidative stress** - Free radicals from metabolism corrode cheaper alloys

**Degradation Timeline**:
- Street Grade: 6-12 months before major failures
- Consumer Grade: 2-3 years with maintenance
- Corporate Grade: 5-7 years 
- Military Grade: 10+ years (using exotic materials)

## **Additional Limiting Factors**

### **1. Neural Bandwidth Limitations**
The human nervous system has finite processing capacity:
- Each implant consumes "neural bandwidth"
- Exceeding limits causes seizures, blackouts, or "cyberpsychosis"
- Most humans max out at 3-5 major enhancements
- Rare individuals ("technopaths") can handle 7-10

### **2. Metabolic Cost**
Enhancements drain the body:
- Cybernetic limbs require 2-3x normal caloric intake
- Neural implants cause chronic fatigue
- Enhanced individuals need expensive metabolic supplements
- Poor nutrition = rapid implant failure

### **3. Maintenance Infrastructure**
Like luxury cars, implants need specialized care:
- Weekly/monthly calibration sessions
- Proprietary diagnostic tools only available at licensed clinics
- Software updates that can brick older models
- Replacement parts deliberately incompatible between manufacturers

### **4. Social Stratification**
Create enhancement "classes":
- **Insurance Coverage Limits**: Most policies cover only basic prosthetics
- **Employment Discrimination**: Many jobs refuse heavily augmented workers (insurance liability)
- **Social Stigma**: "Chromer" slurs, enhancement addiction seen as weakness
- **Legal Restrictions**: Certain enhancements illegal in residential zones

### **5. Technological Obsolescence**
Built-in expiration:
- Manufacturers stop supporting models after 3-5 years
- Security patches discontinued, leaving users vulnerable to hacking
- New implants incompatible with older neural architectures
- "Enhancement debt" - constantly paying to stay current

### **6. Immunosuppression Requirements**
To prevent rejection:
- Daily anti-rejection drugs (expensive, side effects)
- Regular immune system recalibration
- Missing doses = rapid rejection and potential death
- Black market drugs are unreliable/contaminated

### **7. Power Supply Issues**
- Cheaper implants use internal batteries requiring surgical replacement
- Bio-electric generators drain user's stamina
- External charging creates vulnerability windows
- Power cells degrade over time, reducing enhancement performance

### **8. Compatibility Syndrome**
Not all enhancements work together:
- Competing manufacturers use incompatible protocols
- Mixing Street and Corporate grade causes system conflicts
- Some combinations create dangerous feedback loops
- Need expensive "bridge" implants to integrate different systems

### **9. Psychological Dependency**
- Enhanced senses create reality dissociation when offline
- "Phantom enhancement syndrome" - brain expects abilities that aren't there
- Withdrawal causes severe depression and identity crisis
- Many become addicted to the enhancement experience itself

### **10. The "Enhancement Ceiling"**
Physical limits to modification:
- Bone density can only support so much weight
- Brain tissue has finite connection points
- Organs can't sustain unlimited metabolic demands
- Eventually, you're more machine than human (and the human parts fail)

## **Implementation in Your Story**

Consider having different characters represent different limitation struggles:
- **Street character**: Constantly fighting degradation, jury-rigging repairs
- **Corporate employee**: Trapped by maintenance contracts and upgrade cycles
- **Ex-military**: Dealing with unsupported combat hardware
- **Wealthy elite**: The only ones who can truly be "borderline cyborgs" 
- **The unenhanced**: Surprisingly capable through pure skill and determination

This creates narrative tension where enhancement is both necessary for survival in your cyberpunk world but also a constant burden that only the wealthy can truly master. The protagonist could navigate these limitations, perhaps finding clever workarounds that challenge the established system.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these limitation systems or help integrate them into your specific story elements?
