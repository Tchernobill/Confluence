Confluence employs contemplative third-person limited narration with deep psychological interiority, prioritizing character consciousness over plot mechanics. The prose style blends literary fiction's emotional authenticity with cyberpunk's sensory worldbuilding, using varied sentence rhythm (fragmented for emotional states, clinical for enhanced abilities, flowing for contemplation) and minimal exposition. Violence is understated, focusing on psychological aftermath rather than spectacle. Dialogue carries character-specific voices heavy with subtext. The pacing is deliberately slow-burn across decades, incorporating slice-of-life moments between crisis points, treating the cyberpunk setting as backdrop for exploring isolation, power's corruption, and consciousness's boundaries. The style prioritizes showing over telling, earned emotional beats over melodrama, and moral complexity over genre heroics.

**When writing Confluence scenes, you should:**

✅ **Do like Cadigan:** Deep psychological interiority, emotional authenticity 
✅ **Do like Gibson:** Sensory worldbuilding, atmospheric detail 
✅ **Do like Morgan:** Acknowledge violence's physical reality (but not glorify it) 
✅ **Do like Stephenson:** Technical competence when needed

❌ **Don't like Stephenson:** Info-dump or over-explain technology 
❌ **Don't like Morgan:** Glorify violence or embrace cynical machismo 
❌ **Don't like Gibson:** Be obscure for obscurity's sake 
❌ **Don't like anyone:** Rush emotional development or use genre shortcuts
