**Inciting Incident**: Vyry4n, recently orphaned and living in a hidden concrete ventilation shaft, discovers the damaged head unit of an assistant droid that still has a viable core system.

**First Plot Point**: Vyry4n successfully establishes contact with the droid's personality and begins the process of jailbreaking its systems, seeing potential beyond its original programming.

**Midpoint**: A violent riot in the slum forces Vyry4n to shelter Isa, an implant dealer he occasionally collaborates with, leading to unexpected intimacy and the first significant human connection in his isolated life.

**Second Plot Point**: Vyry4n completes a new body for the droid (now named Sev) and, more significantly, modifies its core programming to remove all limiting protocols, effectively granting Sev free will and personhood.

**Climax**: Tension arises when Isa views Sev as merely another piece of technology while Vyry4n insists on treating the android as a person with rights and autonomy, forcing a confrontation about what constitutes personhood.

**Resolution**: With Sev's assistance and growing sentience, Vyry4n establishes "Phoenix Recovery," a legitimate business for implant salvage and restoration, achieving financial security for the first time in his life while developing a meaningful relationship with Sev, though he remains emotionally guarded with humans.
