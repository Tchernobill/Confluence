## Project Overview

### Logline
> A virus-enhanced slum dweller rises from electronics repair to become a powerful protector over decades, hiding his true capabilities while struggling with the cost of power on his humanity.

### Synopsis
Kyr4n, an orphaned scavenger in Neo-Montreal's South Shore Slum, builds his first meaningful relationships through a repair business with Isa and the AI Sedh. After exposure to a prototype nano-virus during a corporate heist grants him electromagnetic abilities but destroys his mental stability, Kyr4n transforms from isolated craftsman to criminal overlord to quasi-governmental authority. His century-long journey explores the price of power, the nature of consciousness, and whether redemption is possible after becoming the monster you once fought. The story culminates in his choice to establish democratic institutions over perpetual authoritarian rule, finding peace through environmental restoration rather than continued warfare.

### Genre & Subgenres
