# TRANSLATION STYLE SHEET

## 1. Translation Philosophy

**Priority Order**
1. Voice equivalence
2. Emotional impact
3. Rhythm & pacing
4. Meaning accuracy
5. Lexical fidelity

The French text must read as if originally written in French.

## 2. Target Register

### Narration
- International French
- Neutral, restrained
- No joual
- Controlled lyricism

### Dialogue

## 3. Tone & Rhythm Rules

## 4. Terminology Rules
