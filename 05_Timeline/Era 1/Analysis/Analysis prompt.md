Analyze the timeline in 'Master Timeline_v.md' for era 1 and 2.

CRITICAL: Work ONLY from the uploaded file. Do not reference any other documents in the project knowledge unless I explicitly tell you to cross-reference.

Before beginning analysis, confirm:
1. The file you're analyzing
2. The date range covered
3. Total number of scenes in the file

Identify and report on:
1. ARC STRUCTURE:
   - List each arc with its actual date range from the file
   - Count scenes per arc
   - Identify the emotional/plot purpose of each arc
1. SCENE SPACING ISSUES:
   - Flag gaps larger than 3 between scenes
   - Flag clusters where [3+] scenes happen in same day/week
   - Assess if spacing matches the emotional weight of events
1. PACING PROBLEMS:
   - Identify events requiring immediate follow-up that don't have it
   - Identify "sustained condition" arcs (illness, relationship development, construction projects) that may need more regular check-ins
   - Note if action sequences are appropriately clustered
1. LOGICAL INCONSISTENCIES:
   - Timeline errors (dates out of order, impossible sequences)
   - Character knowledge problems (knowing things they shouldn't yet)
   - Technology/object timeline issues (using things before acquiring them)
1. RELATIONSHIP TRACKING:
   - For each major relationship pair, track scene count per story phase
   - Identify relationship transitions that lack adequate scene support

Provide your findings as:
1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (1 page)
   - Overall assessment
   - Top 3-5 critical issues
   - Top 3-5 strengths
1. ARC-BY-ARC BREAKDOWN
   - For each arc: purpose, date range, scene count, spacing assessment
   - List scenes in chronological order with dates
   - Flag specific issues
1. GAP ANALYSIS
   - List all gaps larger than 4 with assessment of whether appropriate
   - Identify missing scenes needed (with suggested dates and purposes)
   - "Flag any scene that seems to serve multiple arc purposes"
   - "Identify scene that could serve multiple arc purposes"
1. PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS
   - Critical fixes (timeline errors, major gaps)
   - Important additions (missing relationship development)
   - Nice-to-have depth scenes

Include specific scene counts and date examples in all findings.
