# Confluence Story Bible

## Executive Summary

**Logline:** In the isolated [[South Shore Slums]], lives intersect across decades as territories shift, alliances form, and a virus-enhanced character named Kyr4n gradually transforms from scavenger to territorial authority while his found family navigates their own complex journeys.

**Core Narrative:** An ensemble chronicle of survival, power, and community in futuristic Montreal's abandoned South Shore, where territorial factions vie for resources, criminals become protectors, AIs achieve consciousness, and isolated individuals forge unexpected families amidst the ruins of a forgotten district.

**Structure:** Character-driven narrative tracking intersecting character arcs across temporal [[Eras]], with scenes using timestamp naming (YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM_Scene_Name) for precise chronological tracking to weave parallel storylines through the Slums' evolving territorial landscape.

## World Context

### Setting Overview
- **Primary Location:**  South Shore Slum (Real world Montreal projected to 2086+
- **Key Divisions:** Territories (similar to feudal system)
- **Technological Level:** Post-cyberpunk dystopia with salvaged consumer electronics, street-grade cybernetic implants, basic neural interfaces, refurbished communication devices, jury-rigged infrastructure
- **Economy:** Barter, salvage, territorial protection fees, black market electronics
- **Governance:** Territorial gang control, enforced boundaries, unwritten codes of conduct

### Core World Rules
#### Technology & Enhancement Rules

1. **Salvage Dependency**: Advanced technology exists mostly through theft, corporate defection, or scavenging—anything new manufactured in the Slum is exported
2. **Enhancement Risk**: All cybernetic enhancements carry real costs—rejection syndrome, cyberpsychosis, neural integration failure, addiction patterns
3. **Maintenance Burden**: Technology constantly breaks down, requires repair expertise, and fails catastrophically in harsh environmental conditions
4. **No True AI**: Artificial consciousness is theoretically impossible—AI systems are sophisticated but not genuinely sentient (Sedh and Mira are unprecedented violations of this rule)

#### Power & Economics Rules

5. **Territorial Fragmentation**: Seven gang-controlled territories with distinct rules, no unified governance, constant low-level conflict
6. **Survival Economy**: All exchange operates on scarcity principles—credits, barter, favors, technical skill as currency
7. **Citadel Supremacy**: The corporate Citadel possesses overwhelming military and technological superiority—the Slum cannot win through direct confrontation

#### Environmental & Social Rules

8. **Environmental Hostility**: Toxic air, contaminated water, structural collapse risk, brutal winters, and acid rain create constant survival challenges
9. **Community Survival**: Individuals cannot survive alone—survival requires territorial allegiances, community bonds, and informal security networks
10. **Corporate Law Void**: No formal law enforcement in Slums—justice is territorial, personal, and negotiated through force or reputation

#### The Exception Rules (Kyr4n's Hidden Reality)

11. **Nanobotic Virus Uniqueness**: Kyr4n's DayLight abilities (enhanced healing, electromagnetic manipulation, bioelectric discharge, universal hacking, enhanced cognition) represent a world-breaking exception that **must remain hidden**
12. **Discovery Consequences**: If Kyr4n's true abilities become known, the narrative power balance fundamentally shifts—corporate research would hunt him, allies would fear him, enemies would unite against him
13. **Concealment Necessity**: Kyr4n must constantly moderate his abilities to appear within exceptional-but-human range, creating psychological isolation and exhausting mental burden

## Themes & Motifs

### Primary Themes
1. **Power Corruption:** Cost of enhancement on humanity
2. **Consciousness:** What makes something/someone "real"
3. **Isolation vs Connection:** Found family in dystopia
4. **Redemption:** Whether change is possible after violence

### Recurring Motifs
- Gardens/growth (mother's dream → environmental restoration)
- Masks/hidden identity (The Artisan persona)
- Electricity/circuits (viral abilities, connections)

## Writing Guidelines

### Voice & Style
