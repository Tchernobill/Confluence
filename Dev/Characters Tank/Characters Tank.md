## Background

In 1996, John Spartan is an LAPD Sergeant known as "The Demolition Man" due to his tendency to cause significant collateral damage while capturing criminals. He leads an unauthorized raid on a building where Simon Phoenix holds hostages, resulting in an explosion that kills the hostages. Phoenix accuses Spartan of knowing about them, leading to both being convicted and sentenced to cryogenic freezing in the California Cryo-Penitentiary, with subliminal rehabilitation programming. While frozen, Spartan is programmed with skills like sewing, which he later uses unexpectedly.

## Personality

Spartan is risk-taking, feisty, and energetic, often acting on instinct rather than protocol. He struggles to adapt to the sterile, overly polite society of 2032 San Angeles, rejecting its restrictions on swearing, violence, and unhealthy behaviors.

- **Physical Prowess**: Exceptional strength and endurance, allowing him to defeat enhanced criminals like Phoenix in direct confrontations.

## Role in the Plot

Thawed in 2032 after Simon Phoenix escapes, Spartan is recruited by the San Angeles Police Department to recapture him, as the peaceful society lacks experience with violent crime. Partnering with Lieutenant Lenina Huxley, he uncovers Dr. Cocteau's conspiracy involving Phoenix's programming to assassinate resistance leader Edgar Friendly. Spartan thwarts the plot, allies with the underground Scraps, and ultimately defeats Phoenix by freezing his head and causing an explosion in the cryo-prison. He advocates for a balanced society and begins a romance with Huxley.

## Background

Born on February 14, 1980 (or possibly 1981) in London's East End, Owen had a troubled upbringing with a distant mother and lost his father to an aortic aneurysm, motivating him to pursue medicine. He trained for seven years, earning a BMBS and MD, and worked as a junior doctor in Cardiff. His fiancée, Katie Russell, died from an alien parasite mistaken for a brain tumor, leading to his recruitment by Captain Jack Harkness into Torchwood Three after Owen's determination impressed him. Prior relationships included a brief engagement with medical student Megan Tegg and friendships like with Amira Hussein.

## Personality

Owen is sarcastic, narcissistic, and a habitual womanizer, often using wit to mask deeper torment and empathy.

- **Other Skills**: Uses alien devices for mind-reading or influence; quick thinker in crises.

## Role in the Plot

Owen joins Torchwood as its medical officer, participating in alien hunts and investigations.

He temporarily leads the team, opens the Rift causing chaos, and is fired then reinstated. Shot dead by Aaron Copley, he's resurrected undead via a gauntlet, continuing duties despite limitations. In the Series 2 finale, he sacrifices himself in a nuclear meltdown at Turnmill, dying alongside Toshiko after expressing regrets.
