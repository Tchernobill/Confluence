## Benefits of the 12-Chapter Structure

**Clear Architecture**:

- Forces disciplined pacing (each chapter must earn its place)
- Natural breakpoints for planning and drafting
- Built-in three-act structure (setup/confrontation/resolution)
- Easy to map major plot points

**Manageable Goals**:

- 8,000 words × 12 = 96,000-word novel (solid length for most genres)
- Psychological win: "I'm writing 12 episodes" feels more achievable than "I'm writing a novel"
- Clear progress tracking: "I'm 5/12 done"

**Audience Engagement**:

- Readers trained on TV expect certain rhythms
- Each chapter can have mini-cliffhangers (like episode endings)
- Subplot threads can weave through like TV story arcs
