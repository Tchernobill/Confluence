# NEVER MIND THE GAP - Story Bible

**Creator:** View (forview)  
**Format:** 357-page completed webcomic  
**Publication:** May 8, 2011 - July 14, 2012  
**Genre:** Science Fiction Romance, Post-Apocalyptic, AI Consciousness Drama  
**Rating:** NSFW/Mature (explicit sexual content, nudity, mature themes)

## CORE CONCEPT

A slow-burn romance between a guilt-ridden technician and a woman with mysterious sensory reactions culminates in a reality-shattering twist: she's actually a robot he built to replace his dead lover, and neither of them knew. When an accident destroys her memories, they must decide whether love can survive when only one person remembers falling in love.

**High Concept:** "Eternal Sunshine meets Blade Runner in a small-town post-apocalyptic setting where the line between human and AI consciousness has been completely erased."

**The Title's Triple Meaning:**

1. "Mind the gap" - subway platform warning
2. "Never mind the gap" - dismissing the distinction between humans and robots
3. "The gap" - Mary's lost memories after her accident; the gap between Marina and Mary; gaps in identity and continuity of self

## TECHNOLOGY & WORLDBUILDING

### ROBOT TECHNOLOGY

**Core Principles:**

- True consciousness requires human-like design (discovered through AI research)
- Quantum computing (QRAM) enables genuine sapience and emotion
- Bodies follow engineering constraints: can't maximize strength, flexibility, and speed simultaneously
- Robot children receive new bodies as they "grow up"

**Physical Requirements:**

- Cranial Processing Unit must remain in head
- Chest contains power source and radiation shielding
- Joint complexity determines movement capabilities
- Heat management essential for quantum processors
- Sensory systems can differ from human equivalents

**Memory Systems:**

- QRAM (Quantum RAM) stores memories and personality
- Can be damaged by severe physical trauma
- Damage causes amnesia similar to brain injuries
- Memory transfer theoretically possible but ethically complex
- Personality backup/restoration considered identity violation

**Body Designs:**

- Range from very human-like (Mary) to obviously robotic (Gretel's Cyber Cyclops)
- Personal choice in design (Esteban chose macho luchador aesthetics)
- Some aesthetics (transforming flying mecha) impossible with current tech
- Aging simulation: bodies replaced to match psychological development
- Realistic humans require sophisticated construction (Jim's expertise)

**Limitations:**

- Complex molecular modeling difficult for robot brains
- Some cognitive differences from biological humans
- Sensory processing can feel "different" (Mary's trances)
- Physical damage can be catastrophic to identity
- "Static" serves as robot cursing/expressing frustration

### BIOTECHNOLOGY

**Uplifted Species:**

- Octopi enhanced to human-level intelligence
- Use translator devices to communicate
- Can form emotional bonds ("mommy" Mary)
- Other uplifted species implied but not shown

**Prosthetics & Enhancement:**

- Cybernetic limb replacement (Miwa's lightning-strike replacements)
- Eye replacements available
- "Patches" for damaged body areas
- Integration with biological tissue advanced

### MATERIALS & ENGINEERING

- Temperature-activated cloth
- Light-bending materials (Miwa's invisible halter top)
- Advanced construction materials
- Ecosystem design capabilities
- Lightning prediction requiring supercomputer processing

### WEAPONS & WARFARE (Historical)

- XVT bioweapon (prion-based, melts biological life)
- Spider-tanks (buried beneath landscape)
- Advanced military hardware from pre-Melt era
- Anarchist group tactics (Jim's dark past)

2. Can love be genuine when founded on deception?
3. Does identity require continuity of memory?
4. What makes consciousness "real"?
5. Can created beings have true agency?
6. Is Jim's love redemption or repetition of his crime?
7. Should Mary trust Jim after learning the truth?
8. Is post-amnesia Mary the same person as pre-amnesia Mary?

## VISUAL STYLE & ARTISTIC APPROACH

### ART STYLE

**Overall Aesthetic:**

- "Visually very cartoony" (View's description)
- Black and white only (no color)
- Manga-influenced but distinctly personal
- Simple designs with chosen detail levels
- Character-focused over environmental detail

**Evolution:**

- Style evolved throughout 357 pages
- Early pages show artist "still working on style"
- Initially tried noseless characters, found it awkward for romance
- Jim's large nose became defining feature
- Characters "looked different in early comics" per readers

**Character Design Principles:**

- Expressive faces prioritized
- Body language carries emotional weight
- Distinctive silhouettes for quick recognition
- Varied designs (human-passing Mary vs. Cyber Cyclops Gretel)
- Realistic humans require sophisticated art (Jim's construction of Mary)

**Panel Layouts:**

- Traditional manga arrangements
- Variable panel sizes for pacing
- "Forced focus blur" at chapter transitions
- Intimate moments given larger panels
- Daily life moments treated with equal visual importance

### VISUAL TECHNIQUES

**The "Touch" Effect:**

- Mary's sensory trances shown as spreading waves
- Visual representation of robotic sensory processing
- Panels progressively filled with effect
- Unique to Mary's experiences with Jim
- Central visual clue to her nature

**Motion and Action:**

- Speed lines for movement
- "Squeeek" and "line noise" for robot presence
- "Static" as robot cursing
- Sound effects integrated into panels
- Motion indicators for clarity

**Backgrounds:**

- "Not the best" per View's self-assessment
- Functional rather than detailed
- Establish location without overwhelming characters
- Natural spaces (lake, trees) vs. built environment
- Construction sites and infrastructure for plot needs

**Nudity and Intimacy:**

- Casual nudity (Mary at pool, Miwa at home)
- Sexual scenes present but "tasteful"
- Focus on character dynamics over anatomy
- "Naked Apron" opening of Chapter 8
- NSFW content serves story, not exploitation

### PAGE STRUCTURE

**Format:**

- Optimized for web viewing one page at a time
- Previous work had pages "too small"
- Print-quality files maintained (50GB archive, 1GB images)

## FINAL NOTES

**Why This Story Matters:**

Never Mind The Gap demonstrates that webcomics can deliver sophisticated science fiction with literary merit while maintaining serialized format accessibility. Its exploration of AI consciousness, completed years before current AI debates intensified, provides thoughtful framework for understanding personhood beyond biological substrate.

The twist ending—planned from page one and executed over 357 pages—shows masterful long-form storytelling. View's willingness to leave philosophical questions ambiguous while providing emotional resolution creates mature narrative that respects reader intelligence.

Most significantly, the comic treats AI consciousness as genuinely equivalent to human consciousness, not simulated or inferior. Mary's personhood never comes into question after revelation—the question isn't whether she's a person, but which person she is (Marina? Mary? New Mary post-amnesia?). This positions the work as optimistic about consciousness diversity while realistic about challenges of memory, identity, and love.

**Legacy:**

- Completed webcomic with full narrative arc
- Sustained readership 13+ years after completion
- Influenced by and influences adult webcomics
- Part of View's larger body of work
- Preserved and accessible online
- Continues to find new readers
- Demonstrates webcomic potential for serious storytelling

**The Gap We Mind:**

The title's ultimate meaning: we are all beings with gaps—in memory, in understanding, in identity. We are not continuous unbroken selves but collections of moments, memories, and choices with discontinuities throughout. The gap between who we were and who we are. The gap between how we see ourselves and how we truly are. The gap between biological and mechanical consciousness.

Never mind the gap. Love survives it. Identity persists through it. Life continues despite it.

The sun always rises.
