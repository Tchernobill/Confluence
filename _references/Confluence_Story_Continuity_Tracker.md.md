## CONTINUITY ERROR PREVENTION

### Common Cyberpunk Story Pitfalls

**Technology Inconsistency**:
- âœ— Suddenly having tech that didn't exist before
- âœ— Forgetting limitations established earlier
- âœ“ Maintain tech level consistency unless showing advancement
- âœ“ Track what technology is available when

**Enhancement Logic**:
- âœ— Capabilities appearing only when convenient
- âœ— Forgetting costs when they'd be inconvenient
- âœ“ Always show enhancement costs consistently
- âœ“ Keep capability demonstrations aligned with established limits

**Social Structure Contradictions**:
- âœ— Slum characters suddenly having corporate access without explanation
- âœ— Corporate oppression severity fluctuating based on plot needs
- âœ“ Maintain consistent world power dynamics
- âœ“ Show believable cause for any social structure shifts

---

### Century-Long Timeline Pitfalls

**Age Inconsistencies**:
- âœ— Characters not aging appropriately
- âœ— Forgetting life stage implications
- âœ“ Update physical descriptions for aging
- âœ“ Track energy levels/capabilities changing with age

**Technology Advancement**:
- âœ— Stagnant technology across 100 years
- âœ— Unrealistic leaps in technology
- âœ“ Show gradual, logical technology evolution
- âœ“ Maintain consistency in advancement rate

**Historical Memory**:
- âœ— Characters forgetting major past events
- âœ— Newer characters knowing things they shouldn't about distant past
- âœ“ Show how historical knowledge degrades/transforms
- âœ“ Track what becomes legend vs what's remembered accurately

---

### Multi-POV Pitfalls

**Knowledge Bleeding**:
- âœ— Character knows something only revealed in different POV
- âœ“ Track information revelation carefully
- âœ“ Show characters learning information if needed in their POV

**Voice Blurring**:
- âœ— All POV characters sounding the same
- âœ“ Maintain distinct voices (see Character Bible)
- âœ“ Each character interprets events through their unique lens

**Timeline Confusion**:
- âœ— Unclear when POV switches occur relative to each other
- âœ“ Clear time markers for each POV section
- âœ“ Track simultaneous vs sequential events

---

## REVISION PROCESS

## EMERGENCY FIX PROTOCOL

### When Major Continuity Error Discovered Late

**Step 1: Assess Damage**
- How many chapters affected?
- How many tomes affected?
- Does it impact published/finalized content?
- Severity: Minor detail vs major plot point?

**Step 2: Determine Fix Direction**
Options:
- A) Change early content to match later content
- B) Change later content to match early content
- C) Add bridging content to explain apparent contradiction
- D) Major structural revision if necessary

**Step 3: Map Ripple Effects**
- What else changes if we make this fix?
- Check all related plot threads
- Verify fix doesn't create new contradictions
- Update all tracking documents

**Step 4: Execute Fix**
- Make changes systematically
- Search all content for affected references
- Update Character Bible and Story Continuity Tracker
- Document the fix for reference

**Step 5: Verification**
- Re-check affected sections
- Verify fix works throughout series
- Consider beta reader review of affected areas
- Update tracking systems completely
