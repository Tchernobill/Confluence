# Never Mind The Gap: A Complete Guide

**Never Mind The Gap is a completed science fiction romance webcomic that explores AI consciousness and human identity through an intimate small-town love story.** Created by the pseudonymous American artist "View," this 357-page black-and-white webcomic ran daily from May 8, 2011 to July 14, 2012 on ComicFury. The story follows Jim, a technician haunted by his past, and Mary, a seemingly human woman who experiences overwhelming sensory reactions to his touch—leading to a devastating twist that recontextualizes the entire narrative. The comic earned a **4.83/5 reader rating** and critical acclaim for its thoughtful handling of memory, identity, and what it means to be a person in a post-apocalyptic world where sentient robots live as equals alongside humans.

The webcomic rewards careful reading and rereading. Its title operates on multiple levels—from the mundane subway warning to the profound gap in memory that becomes central to understanding the story's exploration of consciousness and continuity of self. Unlike many webcomics that run indefinitely, View planned the story with a clear beginning, middle, and end, delivering a complete narrative arc that readers continue to discover and analyze more than a decade after its conclusion.

## A deliberately planned narrative with a foundation-shaking twist

The story unfolds in a small lakeside town nicknamed "Nowheresville," set roughly **10-20 years after an apocalyptic event called "The Metropolis Melt."** This catastrophe resulted from a bioweapon strike using XVT—a prion-based substance that melts biological lifeforms on contact—during a war that devastated the old world. In the aftermath, society has rebuilt with humans and sentient robots living together as full equals, the latter powered by quantum computing that enables genuine consciousness and emotion.

Jim and Mary's slow-burn romance drives the central narrative. Jim works as a skilled technician who can repair and build robots, while Mary appears to be an ordinary young woman struggling with confidence and identity questions. Their relationship develops through quiet moments—swimming together, working on projects, navigating the social dynamics of their small community. But something is unusual: when Jim touches Mary intimately, she experiences trancelike sensory waves that gradually fill her entire body, shown visually as spreading effects across comic panels.

The comic's eight chapters—"Children," "Tank," "Beginnings," "Tiptoe," "Filling in the Past," "Bloom," "Bouillabaisse," and "The Sun Always Rises"—carefully build toward a revelation that View planned from the very first page. **Mary is actually a robot, constructed by Jim to replace Marina, his original love who died during the Metropolis Melt.** This twist, hidden through Mary's completely human appearance and her own apparent belief in her humanity, reframes everything. Her trouble with complex molecular structures, the repeated questions about whether she's "a different person than 10 years ago," and her unique sensory experiences all become clues readers can spot on rereading.

The ending delivers a bittersweet conclusion. Mary falls from a collapsing billboard, and the damage reveals her robotic nature while destroying her QRAM (quantum memory), causing her to lose approximately **5-10 years of memories**—including most of her relationship with Jim. The final pages show Jim committing to rebuild their love from scratch, accepting this new version of Mary who doesn't remember falling in love with him. The comic closes with "Exeunt," a theatrical term for characters exiting the stage.

## Characters navigating identity, memory, and what makes us human

**Jim** serves as the male protagonist—a kind, helpful technician in his early twenties with a distinctive large nose that becomes a running visual joke. But beneath his nice-guy exterior lies a dark past. He was once a teenage member of a pro-robot anarchist group, and events from that time led to catastrophic consequences. As he confesses at one point, "I once killed 47 marines for a thumb drive." His guilt over the Metropolis Melt and his role in Marina's death drives much of his character arc. Jim's technical expertise allows him to create remarkably human-like robots, yet this skill becomes both his salvation and his tragedy when he builds Mary to replace what he lost. The comic explores whether his love for Mary is genuine or merely an attempt to resurrect the past.

**Mary**, noticeably shorter than other characters with short hair and a quiet demeanor, represents View's deliberate choice to create "not your average romance heroine"—someone normal and relatable rather than idealized. Her lack of confidence and somewhat immature personality mask the deeper question of her nature. The sensory trances she experiences with Jim's touch, while initially seeming like an unusual quirk or intense emotional response, actually represent her robotic systems processing intimate contact in ways she doesn't understand. Her limitations—like being unable to hold complex molecules in her head—provide subtle hints to her true nature. The character raises profound questions about whether an AI with another person's memories and personality truly _is_ that person, or someone entirely new.

**Miwa** functions as the unrequited love interest and intellectual rival, a genius-level scientist who can predict lightning strikes to within a tenth of a second and design entire ecosystems. She wears an "invisible halter neck top" using light-bending materials, a striking visual that represents the comic's blend of hard science fiction with character-focused storytelling. Despite her incredible intellect—she privately considers everyone around her idiots, except Jim—her perfectionism becomes her fatal flaw. She's had cybernetic parts replaced after being struck by lightning twice, losing one limb and requiring patches on two others plus new eyes. Her childhood friendship with Jim and her sophisticated understanding of technology makes her one of the few people who can match him intellectually, yet she struggles with emotional complexity. Her fear of thunder inspired her lightning prediction program, showing how personal trauma can drive scientific achievement.

**Gretel**, a young robot with a single large circular eye in the "Cyber Cyclops" design, represents the comic's exploration of robot childhood and development. She wants her birthday body upgrade to be a transforming flying mecha—an impossible wish in this relatively hard science fiction setting where robot bodies must trade off between strength, flexibility, and speed. Her genki personality and pleasant demeanor illustrate how robots in this world genuinely grow up, receiving new bodies as they age just as human children grow.

**Cedric and Jack** form a romantic couple that View uses to explore sexual identity complexity. Cedric, shy with over-the-top reactions, wouldn't want to be simply labeled "gay or homosexual," while Jack—wearing an ominously shading duster hat—confidently embraces provocative labels to unbalance people he's talking to. Jack stands out as "the only real jerk" in the cast according to View, yet his relationship with the more sensitive Cedric adds dimension to the comic's exploration of intimacy and connection. View emphasizes that characters are "more complex than a single label," reflecting a nuanced approach to representation.

Supporting characters include **Dr. Kirk**, considered creepy by townspeople despite not wanting to be scary; **Esteban**, a robot with macho luchador aesthetics who chose his own muscular mechanical design; and **the uplifted octopi** who view Mary as their "mommy" and communicate through translator devices. These characters populate a world where diversity of form and consciousness is normalized rather than treated as exceptional.

## A meticulously constructed science fiction world

View builds the setting on a foundation of **"One Big Lie"** science fiction—quantum computing enables human-like AI consciousness, but everything else follows realistic constraints. This places the comic at **Level 4-5 on the Mohs Scale of Science Fiction Hardness**, where speculative technology emerges from plausible scientific extrapolation rather than fantasy.

Robot technology in this world reflects genuine engineering trade-offs. Bodies cannot simultaneously maximize strength, flexibility, and speed—designers must choose priorities. The Cranial Processing Unit must remain in the head, while the chest contains power sources and radiation shielding. Joint complexity matters for movement capabilities. QRAM (quantum RAM) stores robot memories but can be damaged by severe trauma, causing amnesia exactly as brain injuries affect humans. The comic justifies its remarkably human-like robots by noting that AI researchers discovered human-level intelligence and sapience could only be achieved by building very human-like machines.

The post-apocalyptic backstory centers on **XVT, a prion-based bioweapon** that melts biological lifeforms on contact, deployed during a war that involved spider-tanks and other advanced military hardware buried beneath the current landscape. The "Metropolis Melt" killed massive numbers of people approximately a decade before the story begins, and both Jim and Mary (or rather, Marina) were part of pro-robot anarchist groups involved in the conflict's escalation. This background trauma infuses the present-day story with weight—the quiet small-town life exists because the old world's violence burned itself out.

Technology in daily life includes lightning prediction software requiring room-sized supercomputers, temperature-activated cloth, advanced prosthetics, ecosystem design capabilities, and the light-bending materials that create Miwa's invisible top. Yet the world also "Still Has Roombas"—simple automated devices for menial tasks—showing that not all technology reached singularity-level sophistication. The presence of uplifted octopi indicates biological enhancement ran parallel to mechanical development, expanding the definition of personhood beyond both baseline humans and robots.

Society has fundamentally restructured around robot equality. Robots marry humans, write books, raise children (building new bodies as their robot children "grow up"), and participate fully in community life. The comic's casual integration of this diversity—never treating human-robot relationships as scandalous or unusual—creates a vision of post-human society that's optimistic without being utopian. People still struggle with jealousy, trauma, loneliness, and uncertainty. The world has simply expanded who counts as "people" deserving dignity and rights.

## Themes of memory, identity, and the gaps that define us

The webcomic's title reveals its thematic sophistication through multiple meanings. "Mind the gap" references subway warnings about the space between platform and train. "Never mind the gap" dismisses the distinction between humans and robots. But most profoundly, it refers to **the gap in Mary's memory after her accident**—the years with Jim that she can no longer access. As one reader noted, "the reveal at the end is the last nail in the coffin of there being a distinction between humans and robots since we, the audience, couldn't tell them apart. the true turing test, so to speak."

View explores whether identity persists through memory loss, whether love survives when only one person remembers the relationship, and what it means to be "real" when your entire existence might be a reconstruction of someone else. Mary's situation—a robot containing Marina's memories and personality—asks whether she _is_ Marina, or someone new who simply inherited another person's past. The ending's amnesia compounds this question: is Mary-after-the-accident yet another person, or the same Mary with gaps in her continuity?

The comic treats **AI consciousness as genuine rather than simulated**, but explores how quantum computing might create consciousness different from biological brains. Mary's sensory trances when Jim touches her represent not mere programming but her robotic systems experiencing intimacy in ways biological humans cannot. Her inability to process complex molecules hints at cognitive differences even while her emotional life mirrors human experience.

Post-apocalyptic optimism pervades the setting's mood. Rather than dwelling on the Metropolis Melt's horrors, the story shows **how communities rebuild** through cooperation between different forms of consciousness. The small-town setting—with its pools, construction sites, and casual social dynamics—demonstrates that ordinary life continues even after civilizational collapse. This "**20 minutes into the future**" approach grounds the science fiction in relatable human (and robot) experiences.

Sexuality and intimacy receive mature, thoughtful treatment. The comic contains "porny bits" as View acknowledges, including nudity and explicit sexual scenes, but readers and critics consistently praise how **sex serves character and story development** rather than existing for titillation. Mary's sensory experiences with Jim's touch become central to understanding her nature. Miwa's casual nudity in her own home reflects body comfort rather than sexualization. The sexual content explores vulnerability, connection, and the physical dimensions of consciousness across different substrates.

## Cartoony aesthetics serving deliberate storytelling

View describes the art style as "visually very cartoony" and notes that "the pages move much slower" than their previous work. The **black-and-white aesthetic** uses simple designs with carefully chosen detail levels, creating a manga-influenced but distinctly personal visual language. Early pages show the artist "still working on this style"—View initially tried noseless character designs but found it "awkward doing romance" that way, so Jim's prominent large nose became a defining feature.

The style evolved throughout the comic's run, with View noting "my style wanders as the pages progress." Readers comment that characters "looked so different in the early comics," showing genuine artistic development over the 357 pages. Despite View's self-critical assessment that backgrounds are "not the best," the character work carries strong emotional weight through expressive faces, body language, and carefully constructed panel layouts in traditional manga arrangements.

Visual techniques include **"forced focus blur"** effects at chapter transitions, speed lines and motion indicators, and the distinctive "touch" effect representing Mary's sensory experiences as spreading waves across panels. Sound effects integrate directly into panels, with "static" serving as robot cursing and "squeeek" and "line noise" adding texture to robotic presence. Environmental details—pools, bridges, construction sites, interior spaces—ground the science fiction concepts in tangible locations.

View experimented with page size and format, noting previous work had pages "too small" and optimizing these pages for web viewing one at a time. The artist maintains print-quality files (the full archive is **50GB with just images comprising 1GB**), though no official print edition has been released. The decision to keep the art cartoony rather than realistic serves the story's needs, allowing readers to project themselves into characters while maintaining visual clarity in complex emotional scenes.

Nudity appears casually and naturally—Mary in the pool, Miwa lounging in her home—treated as ordinary rather than sensational. The "Naked Apron" scene opening chapter 8 and various sexual sequences earned the comic its NSFW rating, but View's artistic choices keep the focus on character dynamics and emotional intimacy rather than anatomical detail. This approach allows the comic to explore mature themes while remaining, as critics note, "tasteful" and "never gratuitous."

## Publication history and archive structure

The webcomic's production represents a remarkable feat of consistency. From **May 8, 2011 to July 14, 2012**, View posted **one page per day or every two days** once the schedule stabilized, maintaining daily updates throughout the run. The comic comprises eight named chapters with distinct tonal and narrative arcs: "Children," "Tank," "Beginnings," "Tiptoe," "Filling in the Past," "Bloom," "Bouillabaisse," and "The Sun Always Rises."

View uploaded the final chapter in one large chunk after a five-day gap, recommending readers start at page 347 to avoid jumping straight to the climax. This approach demonstrates View's commitment to controlling the reading experience even at the story's conclusion. As View notes about update schedules: "if you don't do it daily, you tend to stop," reflecting the discipline required to complete webcomics.

The comic remains **fully accessible on its original hosting** at nmg.thecomicseries.com through the ComicFury platform, with an alternate URL at nmg.webcomic.ws. The site includes homepage access to latest comics, a complete archive page with chapter listings, a "Random Stuff/Funstuff" page containing extras, and navigation options including Latest, First, Archive, Scroll View, and Subscribe features. The ComicFury comment system preserves reader discussions from 2011 through 2024, creating an invaluable archive of reception history.

Extras include prize sketches from reader contests, fanart posted by View, and additional content created during the comic's run. View held several contests during publication—at pages 45, 107, and 170+—where winners requested character art, often of Miwa who emerged as a fan favorite. The site also features a cast list, rough world map, and panel request section that provide supplementary worldbuilding details.

View completed the story according to plan, stating "I planned the comic from the beginning with a beginning, middle and end—not a never-ending comic." This intentional structure distinguishes Never Mind The Gap from webcomics that run until creator burnout or audience loss forces abandonment. The comic stands as a **complete 357-page narrative** that readers can experience as View intended.

## The artist View and their creative universe

The pseudonymous creator known as **"View" (also "forview" on some platforms)** is an American artist who maintains strict personal privacy while engaging extensively with readers through comments. View has a day job unrelated to art and cites wrist issues that would prevent full-time comic work, yet has produced a remarkable body of work spanning **14+ years from 2011 to 2025**.

View's bibliography includes multiple completed webcomics beyond Never Mind The Gap. **"Cheer"** (completed in 2011, 131 pages) explores romance with bisexuality and polyamory themes, earning reader praise as View's most "inspired work" and having significant impact—one transgender reader noted "This was the first time I questioned my gender identity" after reading it. **"Space Pulp"** (2012-2014) shifted to colored pages and practiced coloring techniques through a "soft" science fiction universe featuring Iridium Lake, a psychic "seer" with Film Noir detective personality.

**"Scrub Diving"** (2014-2017) about scuba diving and cyborgs earned superlative praise from readers as potentially View's best work for its "compelling characters," "well considered sci-fi," and "beautiful human drama." **"Dragons and Silk"** (2018-2021, currently on hiatus) crosses high fantasy with lesbian romance, while **"Moll"** (2024-2025, ongoing) follows an elf mobster in an erotica-focused narrative. View is also developing **"Floating Flowers,"** an adult visual novel/dating game on Itch.io featuring hand-drawn art and regular updates through version 0.8 as of 2024.

View's creative philosophy emphasizes **complete story arcs with planned endings**, mature and sensible characters, natural dialogue, and willingness to experiment with different visual styles. When asked about animation, View acknowledges "Animation's hard!" while expressing love for the medium. View doesn't draw other people's stories, turning down collaboration pitches, and hasn't established a Patreon despite fan requests. The artist gave permission for readers to print or save comics locally, though no official downloads exist.

Throughout the years, View maintains active engagement with the community, still responding to comments on completed works more than a decade after posting. This sustained interaction—combined with View's willingness to discuss creative choices, recommend influences like the manga **Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou**, and share behind-the-scenes thoughts—creates an unusual transparency about the work despite maintaining personal anonymity.

View's recurring themes across works include diverse relationship configurations (heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, polyamorous), science fiction and fantasy settings, character-driven narratives, sexuality as character development, social commentary on identity and rights, and consistent NSFW content that serves story rather than existing for exploitation. This body of work positions View as a significant voice in adult webcomics that balance explicit content with sophisticated storytelling.

## Community, reception, and lasting impact

Never Mind The Gap cultivated a **small but intensely dedicated readership** rather than massive mainstream popularity. With a **4.83/5 rating from 23 votes** on its main hosting site, the comic earned critical acclaim disproportionate to its audience size. Readers frequently describe binge-reading the entire work "front to back in one evening" after discovering it through Reddit recommendations, forum posts, or webcomic directories.

The **TV Tropes page** represents the most comprehensive fan documentation, providing detailed trope analysis, character breakdowns, plot summaries, and thematic exploration. This professional-level fan resource indicates the comic attracted media-studies-oriented readers interested in deconstructing its narrative techniques. Tropedia hosts a similar alternate wiki, while Goodreads lists the work as a book, showing recognition beyond traditional webcomic spaces.

Community interaction primarily occurs through **on-site comments** rather than external platforms like Discord servers or subreddits. The comment sections on individual pages host sustained discussions from 2011 through 2024, with View actively responding even years after completion. This unusual longevity of engagement shows how the comic rewards rereading and continued analysis. Readers debate the ending's implications, discuss backstory details, share emotional responses, and identify foreshadowing they missed on first reading.

Critical reception emphasizes character development and worldbuilding. Reviewer D.J. Bershaw wrote: "**Mature, sensible characters (for all they are young people having sex), masterful pacing, terrific plotting, dialog to die for.**" A 2013 blog review by Malcadon praised it as "a smart and romantic sci-fi" that "somehow stays tasteful, and even funny at times." Readers consistently note the comic as "the first book/story that made me truly love the characters and the first to be worth rereading," with some claiming to have read it "5 times now, and I keep coming back to it."

The ending generated substantial debate among readers. Some found it "disheartening from Jim's perspective"—having to rebuild a relationship where he remembers everything but Mary doesn't. Others praised it as thought-provoking, noting how the title's double meaning about "the gap in Mary's memory" only becomes clear after the twist. Multiple readers expressed that the revelation invites rereading with new perspective to spot clues they initially missed, demonstrating View's successful execution of the long-planned twist.

Fan content remains **limited but meaningful**. The "Random Stuff" page hosts fanart by contributors including klhfxcbnm, Prestidigititis, Lenny (Gisele), and JasperWB. Contest winners requested specific character art, with Miwa emerging as the most popular subject. A YouTuber named Uniquenameosaurus reportedly analyzed the work in 2017, though the specific video hasn't been located. No fan fiction, wikis, or fan games exist, but the quality of discussion in comment sections compensates for lack of extensive fan production.

Readers frequently requested **printed or collected editions**, with View responding that while the artist maintains print-quality files, no resources exist to produce official physical versions. View gave permission for personal printing and local archiving, acknowledging the value of preservation while unable to provide commercial distribution.

The comic's influence extends through **cross-pollination with View's other works**. Readers of Cheer discovered Never Mind The Gap and vice versa, creating a sustained audience following View's creative evolution. Discovery patterns through Reddit, webcomic directories like Comic Rocket, and adult comic communities on Hentai Foundry ensured the work reached audiences specifically interested in mature, character-driven narratives rather than broader general audiences.

## Understanding Never Mind The Gap's enduring significance

More than a decade after completion, Never Mind The Gap stands as an exemplar of webcomic potential for serious science fiction storytelling. Its exploration of consciousness, memory, and identity through intimate human (and robot) relationships demonstrates how the medium can tackle philosophical questions while maintaining emotional accessibility. The twist ending—planned from the first page—shows sophisticated narrative construction rivaling traditional published fiction.

View's decision to complete the story according to plan rather than extending it indefinitely gives Never Mind The Gap unusual integrity. The bittersweet ending serves thematic purposes even when disappointing some readers who wanted happier closure. This willingness to prioritize artistic vision over audience preference reflects View's position as an independent creator answering to creative imperatives rather than commercial pressures.

The comic's approach to AI consciousness as genuinely equivalent to human consciousness while exploring differences in substrate creates a nuanced position in science fiction debates about personhood. Mary functions as what View called "the true Turing test"—readers cannot distinguish her from biological humans until the reveal, forcing recognition that consciousness itself, not its physical implementation, determines personhood. This philosophical stance has become increasingly relevant as artificial intelligence technology advances.

The work's mature handling of sexuality and nudity demonstrates how explicit content can serve storytelling rather than existing as exploitation. View's integration of sexual scenes into character development—particularly Mary's sensory experiences with Jim's touch as central to understanding her nature—shows how adult content can be both erotic and narratively essential. This approach influenced subsequent adult webcomics attempting similar balance.

Never Mind The Gap ultimately succeeds because it tells a **small story about ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances** rather than attempting epic scope. The quiet lakeside town, the slow-burn romance, the daily life of robot children getting body upgrades and scientists predicting lightning—these intimate details create emotional investment that makes the philosophical questions matter personally. When Mary loses her memories in the final pages, it devastates because readers have watched those memories form page by page across 357 days of updates.

The gap in Mary's memory mirrors the gap readers feel between who she was and who she becomes—the gap between Marina and Mary—the gap between human and robot consciousness—and ultimately, the gaps in all our lives where memory, trauma, or simple forgetting creates discontinuities in self. View asks us to never mind these gaps, to accept that love, identity, and personhood persist despite lost continuity, and that choosing to rebuild what was lost represents hope itself in a post-apocalyptic world.
