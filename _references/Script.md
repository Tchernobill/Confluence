## **Chapter 1: Nevermind the Gap**

The countryside was a quiet patchwork of overgrown grasses and ancient stonework. The sun hung high and bright, washing out the colors of the sprawling fields. A crumbling stone wall, a relic of a forgotten property line, was broken by a gap where the stones had tumbled away.

Through the tall grass, a girl named Mary waded into a shallow stream. She wore cutoff shorts and a loose jacket, her short hair ruffled by the breeze. She bent forward, hands on her knees, peering intently into the water.

*Squeak. Squeak.*

The rhythmic sound of ungreased wheels approached from the distance.

Mary froze. She spotted a triangular stone in the water, but her attention snapped to the road beyond the wall. A man with long hair tied back in a ponytail was walking along the path, dragging a heavy, two-wheeled cart laden with equipment.

*Squeak. Squeak.*

Mary scrambled out of the water and ducked behind a thick tree trunk, pressing her back against the bark. She held her breath. The man, Kersie, trudged past the gap in the wall. He didn't break his stride, but his eyes slid sideways, landing precisely on the tree where she was hiding. He knew she was there. He didn't stop.

Kersie continued toward a massive structure rising from the plains—a retro-futuristic train station with a curved, hangar-like roof. A small, rusted rail vehicle sat on the tracks.

Inside the station, the shadows were long and the air smelled of dust and ozone. Kersie parked his cart and plugged a heavy cable into a wall socket.

*Clink.*

He paused. The sound of metal hitting concrete echoed from a ventilation shaft near the floor.

Kersie turned just as Mary came tumbling out of the vent. "WAUGH!" she cried, losing her balance.

She landed squarely on top of him. "WHUMP."

Kersie lay flat on his stomach, groaning into the floor. Mary stood triumphantly—if awkwardly—on the backs of his legs, her bare feet leaving wet prints on his trousers.

"..." Kersie lifted his head. "Your feet are filthy, aren't they."

"The filthiest!" Mary beamed down at him.

Kersie rolled over and sat up, brushing off his pants. "What's up?"

Moments later, the tension had evaporated. They sat on the floor of the empty station, sharing a bag of apples.

"The wiring isn't up to my specs," Kersie said, chewing thoughtfully.

"Is the ricket-rail going to extend out here?" Mary asked, gesturing to the tracks outside.

"Depends on the new owners, I guess..." He took a bite. *Crunch.* "Haha, a thousand kilometers of ancient railroads?"

"These old rails run all the way to Metropolis, don't they?" Mary asked, eyes wide.

"Let's not get our hopes up," Kersie smiled softly.

"I'm not an idiot..." Mary muttered, blushing slightly.

*Crunch, crunch.*

The heavy metal door creaked open. A tall, muscular man named Jianguo stood in the doorway.

"Ah, here you are," Jianguo said, looking relieved.

"You need me why?" Mary asked, hugging her knees.

"There's an injured octopus..." Jianguo said flatly.

Mary sighed.

Jianguo looked at Kersie. "She won't talk to us, just keeps asking for you."

Kersie shrugged. "Do I look like their mom?"

Mary stood up, resigned. She walked past Jianguo into the sunlight. "Oh! Um, see you!" she called back to Kersie.

"Bye..." Kersie waved as the door creaked shut.

***

**Creakers**

Kersie pushed his squeaky cart into town. He parked it outside a corner establishment with a sign that read *CREAKERS*.

Inside, the bar was cool and dim. Patrons played chess at small tables. Behind the counter stood a robot wearing a tie, his head a blocky, minimalist casing with two glowing eyes.

*Chingalingaling.* The door chime announced Kersie.

"Oh, Jim," Kersie greeted the bartender.

"Hey, Kersie. Lunch?" Jim the robot asked, holding up a bottle.

Kersie stared. "Is something wrong?"

Jim was pouring a drink, but he was missing the glass entirely. The liquid splashed onto the counter. *Tokka tokka tokka.*

"I think I lost a control chip," Jim said, staring blankly at the mess. "It is very troublesome."

"I have my kit..." Kersie sighed.

A few minutes later, Kersie was seated at the bar, tools spread out. He had opened the access panel on the side of Jim’s head.

"Just don't disconnect my qmem, okay?" Jim asked.

"No worries, it's all green," Kersie muttered, plugging a diagnostic device into the robot's skull.

"I'm writing a book, and if I were reset to factory default..."

"I look forward to reading it," Kersie said. He frowned at the readout. "Yeah, your KPU and backup both burned out."

"Bothersome," Jim said.

Kersie sat back, eating a fruit cup while Jim adjusted his neck servos. A woman named Carol sat nearby, along with a large robot with a transparent dome head.

"I know you're built super-durable, but you still need to be maintained!" Kersie lectured, pointing a spoon at Jim. "Doctor Kirk unnerves me..."

"Really? I like him..." Jim replied. "You're not a robot, Jim..."

Carol leaned in. "Kersie, I'm already maintaining half a dozen folks at home. One more'd be no trouble."

Kersie considered this. "...I'll take you up on that, Carol."

"OK!" Carol flashed a peace sign.

"You maintain six people?" Kersie asked.

"Yeah!" Carol laughed nervously. "Because they all hate Dr. Kirk?"

"Err... ah... I'm sure they have various reasons? Ahahaha..." Carol sweated. She glanced at the dome-headed robot beside her. "He's creepy."

*WHANG.* Carol casually punched the dome-headed robot in the chest. "I'll make lunch," she announced brightly.

At the other end of the bar, a man in a cowboy hat, Jack, downed a shot. "That rail station is pretty far out in the sagebrush," Jack grumbled. "Is this going to interfere with my goddamn biome, kid?"

Kersie rubbed his temples. "Uh... I don't know..."

"Ask them when they move in..." Kersie deflected.

"Tch..." Jack pulled his hat down.

Kersie stood up and walked over to a bald man sitting quietly at a table. He grabbed the man by the arm. "I'll do that."

"Jack, you said you'd drive me home!" Kersie shouted, dragging the confused bald man toward the door.

"Jack!" Kersie yelled again.

***

**Evening**

The sun was setting, casting long shadows across the plains. Kersie knelt by a service pole in the tall grass. *Breedle breep.* He scanned an access panel.

Nearby, a large fan-like satellite dish sat motionless.

"Why are you broken?!" Kersie yelled, smacking the base of the dish. *Pang.*

"Fuhh. I'll leave it until tomorrow," he sighed.

The roar of an engine approached. Kersie turned to see Jianguo pulling up on a sleek, heavy-duty motorcycle.

"Yawnnn," Kersie stretched. "Headed home?"

"Yeah, it got late," Jianguo said, idling the bike. "Listen, Marina seemed really upset..."

"Really? Why?" Kersie asked, grabbing his cart.

"Something about that octopus," Jianguo said, face scrunched in confusion. "I'll stop by and see what's up."

"Thanks..."

Kersie hitched a ride. The motorcycle sped through the darkening woods, towing Kersie and his cart behind. They arrived at a small residential area near the tracks, the windows of the houses glowing warmly in the night.

Kersie walked to the tracks where his Ricket Rail vehicle waited. He boarded the glass-walled cabin and engaged the engine. *Vrrrrrrr.*

The vehicle hummed down the tracks, arriving at a modern, multi-story house overlooking the water.

"North Quay, now stopping," the automated voice announced.

Kersie stumbled out, exhausted. "YAAAWNNN."

He unlocked the front door. "Maaary!"

No answer.

"Hey Mary!" He walked through the house to the back deck, which led out to a pier. "Mary? Where *are* you?"

He walked to the end of the dock. A pile of clothes lay on a bench—a shirt, shorts, underwear.

Kersie looked down into the dark water. *Huh...*

Bubbles broke the surface. A shape rose rapidly from the depths.

*SPLAKSHH!*

Mary burst from the water. She was wearing a sleek, high-tech mono-fin, but as she breached, she kicked hard, and the fins detached, flying into the air.

She landed on the dock, gasping. Then she froze. She was completely naked.

Kersie stood there, staring.

Mary’s eyes went wide. She scrambled to cover herself.

"..." Kersie turned around immediately. "Um?"

"Go inside," Mary squeaked, hiding behind the bench. "And make the walls full dark. Please?"

Kersie walked back into the house, sliding the glass door shut. "Kiki - full dark."

*Bweep. SHUNKK.* The smart-glass windows instantly turned opaque black.

Kersie sat at the table in the sudden gloom, his face flushing slightly.

The sliding door opened. "Kiki, full bright," Mary's voice commanded.

The windows cleared. Mary stood there, dressed in a t-shirt and shorts, drying her hair with a towel. She refused to make eye contact.

"W... You want some tea?" she asked quietly.

"No thanks, it's pretty late," Kersie said, looking away.

"ARGH you totally saw me naked!" Mary screamed, squatting down and hiding her face in her hands.

"Uh... yeah. I guess I did."

"Don't be so casual! It's a big deal to me! I feel HUMILIATED."

"Don't worry, I've seen you naked before..."

"That was TEN YEARS AGO," Mary shouted, pointing an accusing finger. "I'm a whole different person now, idiot!"

"Harumph." She crossed her arms.

"I'm really sorry," Kersie said gently.

"It's fine. Let's move on."

They sat at the table. "Anyway, I heard you were pretty upset?" Kersie asked.

"Oh YEAH—that's why I was trying to relax in the first place!" Mary slammed her hands on the table. "Jianguo SABOTAGED the spider dredge!"

"Pisses me off! He sabotaged it?"

"Yeah, he- uh... he... well..." Mary's anger deflated. "Uh... he unplugged it. Said he wanted to take a day and talk..."

"And it fell over on the octopus?"

"N-no... It just settled into park. I'm, uh... unclear as to why she was clinging to the pneumatics..." Mary rubbed her head, embarrassed. "Mhm. I, um... I overreacted, I guess."

Kersie smiled. "I know better than anyone, living alone makes troubles seem bigger. Hey, you see Gretel more than me. This is her birthday present."

He slid a small card across the table.

Mary picked it up. "Huh? Um, okay." She looked at the image on the card. "Wow, this's... Huh?"

She looked up, but the sliding door was open and the room was empty. Kersie was already walking down the dark path to his rail car.

"Jim?" she whispered, recognizing the design.

"Ass," she muttered, watching his vehicle depart. She turned back to the empty house. "Kiki, Lights out."

Upstairs, Mary flopped into bed. "...I guess I was pretty childish..." She sighed and drifted into sleep.

Later in the night, the moonlight bathed her room. Mary frowned in her sleep. *RRRGH!* She thrashed, her legs tangling in the sheets, binding together as if fusing into a single limb. She kicked out, sending a pillow flying across the room. *FWAK.* She curled into a tight ball, her lower body wrapped tight like a tail in the moonlight.

***

## **Chapter 2: Children**

*BINGBONG.*

The doorbell chimed. It was morning.

Mary woke up groggily, drool on her cheek. "Huh?"

"We're having game here this week!" a child's voice shouted from outside.

Mary looked out the window. Standing on the lawn were four figures: Gretel (a robot girl with a ponytail sensor), a robot boy in a cap, a human boy, and a girl with an afro.

"It's okay, right? We'll set up without you!"

"What's with all these visitors?" Mary groaned, rubbing her eyes. "It is 7:05."

Downstairs, the group had already sprawled out on the floor. Maps, dice, and character sheets were scattered everywhere.

"I'm so gonna take a level in barbarian!" the afro-haired girl declared. "You just want to use that magic sword! Let's sell it!"

"Guys, it's not even 7:30..." Mary mumbled, walking down the stairs in her pajamas.

"You said 'Saturday morning'," the robot boy chirped. "Good morning!"

Mary sighed and went to the kitchen. She returned with a tray of drinks.

"Coffee? Oh, thanks!" the afro-haired girl said. "With lots of milk, like you like it!"

"Mmm..." Mary sat down, sipping her cup. "Gretel, your birthday is soon, right?"

Gretel, the robot with the single-eye optical sensor, perked up. "Yeah! Next week I get my adolescent body! And set my new factory default!"

"But you know that..." Gretel giggled.

Mary reached into her pocket. "Hee hee hee..." She pulled out the card Kersie had given her.

"It's done! It's done!" Mary cheered, holding up the picture.

"Lemmee see!" The kids crowded around.

"I'm CUTE!" Gretel squealed. "Yeah! Oh, let *me* see!"

The human boy blushed. "Um... C-can I see?"

Gretel showed him. "OK."

"YAY!" Gretel tackled Mary in a hug. "Waugh!"

"It was such a great idea to get you to get Jim to build me!" Gretel said, squeezing Mary tight.

"Yeah?" Mary patted the metal plating.

"Does it fly and transform?" Gretel asked breathlessy.

"Uh?" Mary blinked.

The game continued. Dice clattered across the floor.

"The icy mountain storms have killed lesser folk, but you shelter in a cave until it passes..." the DM narrated.

"The cave dwellers worship the sigil and sacrifice to the horrifying gods it summons," the afro-haired girl read from a sheet. "Horrifying gods like, say, that one."

"Argh! I can't reach the black candles from here! Let's throw rocks!"

"SPLAT!"

"Another day, another level for the rogue," the robot boy said.

At noon, the game broke up.

"Okay, see you next week," Mary waved from the door.

"At the game center," she called after them. "And at NOON."

She watched them leave, her smile fading into a look of determination. "Well... I got stuff to do..."

***

**Lakeview**

Mary arrived at a metal silo structure near the marshes. She swiped her access card. *Vreep.* The light turned green, but the handle didn't budge.

*Clank. Urmph!* She hauled on the lever. Nothing.

*kaTUNK. TUNK.* She braced her foot against the wall and pulled with all her weight.

*WHAM.* The door flew open, sending Mary sprawling onto her back in the grass. "Ow..."

She picked herself up and glared at the door. She grabbed a heavy metal case from inside. "Hhup!" Dragging it by a tether, she marched toward the water.

The marsh was deeper than usual. Mary waded in, her boots sinking into the mud. She passed a ventilation pipe sticking out of the water. Floating nearby were several small, boxy drones.

"What the..." She lifted one of the drones. Mud and weeds poured out of its intake. "How did this... I don't even... sigh."

"GO TO STOREHOUSE AND WAIT," she commanded the drone. It chirped weakly and bobbed away.

She reached the main building, marked *LAKEVIEW RESEARCH* with a cartoon whale logo.

Inside, Jianguo and several others were working. A large glass tank dominated the room.

"Hey, there's a busted eyeball in the lock..." Mary announced. "Could one of you engineery folk go figure it out?"

"I'll do it," Jianguo said.

"Hi, Mary. Nice to see you," a woman with dark hair said coolly.

"Ha ha, ah... hi, nice to see everyone, in a hurry..." Mary waved awkwardly.

She walked over to the tank. A large octopus clung to the glass. "Hey, Chell. Hi!"

Mary tapped the glass. A small speaker on the tank crackled. "How you feelin?"

"Fine, but it hurt a lot," the synthesized voice of the octopus replied.

"I'm gonna go talk to that guy right now, so forget about it, okay?" Mary said soothingly.

"Well... Can I have a lollipop?" Chell asked.

"If you promise to be nice to the dwarves." Mary reached into a jar on the counter.

"Okay! I promise!"

Mary dropped a lollipop into the tank. The tentacle caught it deftly.

"Thanks mom," the computer voice said.

Mary froze. Her face turned bright red. *Snerk.* Behind her, Jianguo's colleague stifled a laugh. "Hah..."

*WHAP WHAP.* Mary turned and smacked the laughing colleague. "Put the translator back the way it was!" she shrieked.

"I've got to run, so fix it!" Mary pointed a warning finger at them.

"Yes, mom..." Jianguo teased as she stormed out.

"Rrghhh." Mary jammed her hat down on her head.

Outside, Jianguo watched her leave. A woman named Miwa walked in, looking tired.

"Sigh... She made a mess again..." Jianguo said, looking at muddy footprints on the floor. "Shoko, cleanup." A cleaning bot whirred to life.

Mary marched through the manicured gardens of a nearby estate. She crossed a small bridge and approached the front door.

*Bingbong.*

The door opened. A tall woman with braided hair and glasses looked out. "Ah, Mary."

"Oh, Miwa."

"Uhm is Jianguo home?" Mary asked, looking up at the brim of her hat.

"Dad left ten minutes ago to do flood surveys," Miwa said, leaning against the doorframe.

"Argh... So close." Mary slumped.

"Is it an emergency?" Miwa asked.

"No..."

"Tell him we'll talk next week," Mary said, turning to leave. "Hey." Miwa called out. Mary stopped. "Take it easy tonight, yeah?" Miwa’s expression softened behind her glasses.

"Huh? Uh, sure. You too."

Mary boarded the train back to North Quay. *Takkatakkatakka.*

As the landscape blurred by, Mary slid off the seat and curled up on the floor of the empty train car. "Last night went so badly..." she whispered to herself.

***

**Apologies**

"North Quay, now stopping."

Mary trudged off the train. She slapped her hat against her leg. "Sigh..."

"Wait... It's okay..." She stood up straight. "I just need to act less childish. It'll work out just fine."

She looked toward the horizon. "He's probably still at that rail station! I'll go apologize right now!"

She jumped onto her scooter and sped off.

*KssssssHHH.* Rain began to fall.

Simultaneously, the Ricket Rail pulled up to Mary's house. *CLAKKA CLAKKA.* Kersie stepped out, holding a cup of coffee. "Good morning! Hi!"

He waved at the empty house.

Meanwhile, Mary arrived at Kersie's station—which was actually a converted house. She walked up the path.

*Ding.* She pressed the doorbell. No answer.

"Sigh..." Mary wiped sweat from her forehead. "It's hot."

She waited. The humidity was rising. She pulled at the collar of her sleeveless shirt. She unzipped the front slightly. Then a bit more. She fanned herself.

*Dadadong.* She rang the bell again.

The door clicked open.

"Hiyah." Kersie stood there. He had clearly just woken up. His hair was loose, hanging over his face, and he was wearing nothing but a towel around his waist. He had a cigarette in his mouth.

"Oh! You woke up late..." Mary stammered, staring up at him.

"I can come back."

"Had insomnia. Mm," Kersie grunted.

They stared at each other.

"Well, come on in," Kersie stepped back.

"Mmkay." Mary walked past him, eyes fixed firmly on the floor.

"WAUGH!" Mary screamed again.

In the middle of the living room sat a robotic torso—no head, no legs—mounted on a wheeled stool. It was holding dumbbells and lifting them up and down. *Squeakie squeakie.*

"I'm double-checking joint fatigue rates," Kersie explained casually, closing the door.

"I thought somebody died, you jerk!" Mary yelled, pointing at the macabre machine. "Don't put creepy shit in your living room!"

"Sorry, give me a moment." Kersie wheeled the torso away.

*FWAK.* Mary slapped her own cheeks. "Childish..." she scolded herself.

Kersie returned a moment later, buttoning a shirt. "So, um, what're your plans?"

"A few people to talk with, then I'm done," Mary said, leaning against the wall.

"It's hot out," Kersie said. He tossed a grey t-shirt at her. "Wear this or you'll boil."

"If you say so."

Mary changed into the t-shirt, which had a simple smiley face on it. "It's a nice day to have off..."

"Wanna tag along?" Kersie asked, pulling his hair back.

"That's the plan!" Mary grinned.

They walked into town along the tracks. The streets were bustling.

"Hey Dr. K!" Mary waved.

An older man with wild white hair and round glasses stopped. He was carrying shopping bags. "Oh, hi you two."

"Hmmm." Mary scrutinized him.

"Heyyyy~ nice 'mad genius' look!" she gave him a thumbs up.

Dr. Kirk buried his face in his hand. "...I wanted a kind of 1960s 'John Lennon' look..."

"John FRANKENSTEIN, maybe..." Mary mused. "Victor," she corrected herself.

Dr. Kirk walked away, grumbling, a dark cloud hanging over his head.

"Thanks! Now I don't have to do that talk after all. Eh?" Kersie said.

"But I like 'mad genius' style," Mary protested. "I didn't mean any insult..."

They arrived at a cafe. Jack the cowboy was standing on the porch.

"Well, who else do you need to talk to?" Mary asked.

"This guy," Kersie said. "'sup Jack."

"It's just that Boulder shorted us on crude," Jack said, leaning on the railing. "Jim, listen to this. OK?"

Inside the cafe, a woman sat with her head in her hands, listening to the conversation drift in from outside.

Mary leaned against the railing, enjoying the breeze, while Kersie and Jack talked business. For a moment, the gap between them felt small enough to step over.

### second batch


The town center was bustling under the midday sun. Mary leaned against the railing of the café terrace, her posture slumping slightly as she addressed the man in the cowboy hat.

"Do you need my help?" she asked, her voice lacking genuine enthusiasm.

Jack crossed his arms, leaning back against the wall. "No, I'll handle it."

Behind them, a scooter whined in the distance, growing louder. Mary turned to see Jianguo pulling up to the curb. His daughter, Marina, rode behind him, looking distraught, while another child clung to her waist.

"But I—" Mary started.

"I'm *busy*," Jack snapped, dismissing her.

"Marina!" Mary called out, ignoring Jack’s tone.

Jianguo brought the bike to a halt. He didn't look happy. Marina was practically hiding her face.

"The octopi are having some kind of civil war," Jianguo announced, his expression grave. "There's been a death."

The absurdity of the statement hung in the air, but Jianguo’s face made it clear this wasn't a joke.

***

Moments later, the roar of the engine filled the air again. Jianguo adjusted a helmet over Mary’s head. "Ow! Nails!" she complained as he clipped the strap.

They sped off, weaving through the streets until they reached a quiet café patio where a young woman with glasses sat reading.

*Vrrrrrrrr.* The bike idled.

"So we—" Mary began, hopping off the bike before it had fully stopped.

*Whumph.*

She launched herself at the woman, tackling her in a hug from behind. The woman, Miwa, barely looked up from her drink, though she buckled slightly under the weight.

"Anyway, I think they might be running low," Mary said into Miwa's ear, continuing a conversation only she was having.

Miwa sighed, adjusting her glasses as Mary clung to her back like a koala. In the background, Jack and Jim—who everyone also called Kersie—were deep in conversation near a metal bed frame that had been repurposed as a fence.

"You're too big to keep doing this!" Miwa grunted, trying to maintain her balance.

"You vanished after my birthday!" Mary accused, tightening her grip. "I've been looking for you for a week."

Miwa ignored the accusation and tilted her head toward the two men. "He's secretly renovating that old train station."

Mary peeked over Miwa's shoulder. "Secretly, hm?"

"Anyway," Miwa continued, "we need to find another source for petroleum. Jianguo said he could refine it from six-month peat..."

Jack tipped the brim of his hat, looking up at the canopy of trees above them. "We'd need a whole lot more rain."

"Well, it's not impossible," Miwa said, finally dislodging Mary enough to look her in the eye.

Mary’s face lit up. She squeezed Miwa tighter. "Oh, Project Rainforest! That's me!"

"Gak..." Miwa choked as the hug constricted her windpipe.

"Hey, I'm the premier ecological meteorologist and my predictions have been the official town predictions since I was *this* high!" Mary bragged, gesturing with one hand while strangling Miwa with the other. "So don't give me that look!"

Miwa patted Mary’s arm, signaling surrender. "Sorry, we just haven't got used to you being an adult. Down, please..."

Mary hopped down, smoothing her shirt. "Hurhum."

"I'll get together with dad and put together a plan for long-term ecoforming," Miwa said, all business. "You two will have the proposal next week."

Mary smirked, twirling a strand of hair. "That sounds promising..."

"Yeah, I'll get on it..." Mary said, her eyes drifting away. She leaned her chin on Miwa's shoulder again. "Tomorrow."

"Oh, I'm gonna get us some coffee. Be right back!" Mary announced suddenly, slapping Miwa on the back before darting off.

Miwa watched her go, annoyed but fond.

"Miwa's always been touchy-feely, but..." Jack muttered, watching Mary pirouette in the distance. "Maybe she should get herself a boyfriend."

Jim glanced at the cowboy. "She obviously agrees."

Miwa approached them, looking unamused.

"It's pretty miraculous that a cold fish like you has two girls chasing you," Jack said to Jim, ignoring Miwa's glare.

Jim blinked, genuinely confused. "Huh? Miwa and me?"

"Wh... what should I do?" Jim asked, panic creeping into his voice.

Jack grabbed Jim by the shoulders, staring him dead in the eyes. "Calm down and listen to my advice. You should fuck her."

Jim’s face went blank.

"She'd tear your life apart like a puppy with a newspaper," Jack said with dark satisfaction, visualizing a cute puppy destroying a log. "And that's just what you need."

Jim stared at him. Then he pulled a cigarette from his pocket. "I meant 'how should I turn her down?'"

"I think I'll aim for Mary," Jim added thoughtfully.

Jack rolled his eyes. "Oh great, the most boring couple ever. You'll have boring dates. Boring kisses. Boring official hook-up. Boring hang-out. Boring sex. Boring move-in-together. Boring nothing-fucking-happens. Until a boring illness. And a boring hospital visit. With a boring proposition..."

"Nothing will change," Jack finished, looking disgusted. "I've seen this same shit 47 times."

Jim lit his cigarette. "... You watch a lot more romcoms than I thought."

Jack pulled his hat down over his eyes, his cheeks flushing.

"Anyway, Miwa's just a kid," Jim said, watching the street.

"BRUTAL," Jack muttered.

Down the street, Mary returned with coffee and donuts. "Bagelthing," she said, handing one to Jim.

"Thanks. What's up?" Jim asked.

"He was saying nice things about you behind your back," Jim said, biting into the donut.

"Who, Jack?" Mary looked back at the cowboy, who was standing alone with his back to them. "...Really?"

Miwa took a sip of her drink and glared at Jack's distant figure. "Dear Boulder: unless you deliver, I will kick you in your teeny-tiny testicles."

Mary watched Jim eat. "Oh, I thought you drank it with milk and sugar."

"Not for a long time!" Jim said. "You like it black, right? Yeah, black's best."

Mary took a sip of her own pitch-black coffee, trying not to grimace. "Hee hee hee."

***

They walked toward the edge of town, where the architecture became curved and futuristic.

"Where are we going?" Mary asked.

"Esteban's," Jim replied.

Mary stopped dead. "Aw! I needed to talk to Jack! I forgot!"

Ahead of them, Franzi—a woman in a flowing skirt—was playing with two children. Or rather, she was swinging her arms as if holding hands with children, but there was no one there.

"Oh, who are you playing with? I can't see her!" Mary called out, shielding her eyes. "She must be wearing camo!"

"Yeah, yeah," Jim chuckled, walking past.

"Oh, I thought you were chasing down Jack!" Franzi laughed as Mary approached.

"These aren't my jetboots," Mary said randomly.

"Well, I— Hey, Miwa!" Mary greeted Franzi.

"Hey, Franzi!" Franzi corrected.

"Upah!" Someone bumped into them.

"See ya!"

"Jim, I mean Miwa!" Mary stammered, her brain short-circuiting.

"My favorite girl!" A booming voice echoed from the doorway. "Oh, but you're too young for me now! Go date an adolescent!"

A massive, broad-shouldered robot painted in white and gold stepped out.

"Hey, long time no see!" Jim greeted him.

"You look great!"

"I'm busy now, but I'll come back next week," Mary told someone off-screen.

"OK! We'll hold you... to... that?"

The group shuffled into the house. Suddenly, a towering shadow loomed in the darkened hallway.

"AMIGO!" the shadow roared.

"ESTEBAN, I WAS TALKING!" Mary shrieked as the shadow grabbed her.

"AMIGA!"

Mary was hoisted into the air by the massive robot, her legs dangling. "sigh," she resigned herself to the manhandling.

Inside, the atmosphere was warmer. Esteban, the large robot, sat shirtless (as much as a robot could be), looking jovial.

"HELLO AGAIN!"

"Hey! Been a while," Franzi said, bringing out a plate. "I made cookies."

"Ooo." Mary took one. "Whatsup?"

Esteban placed a heavy hand on Franzi’s shoulder. "We want to have a kid."

"Oh! Congrats!" Mary said, chewing.

Franzi turned to Jim. "My oldest friend, would you do us the honor of building a little boy?"

"We'll call him 'Takeshi'," Franzi beamed.

"Oh, Japanese!" Mary noted.

"Sure," Jim said easily. "Which of you should he take after?"

Franzi pointed to Esteban. Esteban pointed to Franzi.

"The town needs another técnico, so he will be a big boy, yes?" Franzi asked.

"Of course!"

"Make him cleverer than me!" Esteban laughed.

"Oh, are you going to try a cookie?" Franzi asked Mary, who was staring.

"Don't you want to talk about Takeshi?" Franzi teased. "Truthfully... Jim and I already put together ten terabytes of info on what Takeshi should be like. Don't tell Esteban, though!"

"I'm more interested in your shirt," Mary admitted. "I trust you to create perfection!"

Mary reached out and pulled at the fabric of Franzi's top. It snapped apart in her hands.

"Fek! I broke your shirt!"

"It's fine!" Franzi laughed. "I'm using a new kind of joint. It's flexible, but the real advantage is the low maintenance."

"You just reset it," she demonstrated, the fabric snapping back together.

"Is it suitable for me?" Mary asked.

"Maybe in ten years!" Franzi winked. "It uses adaptive magnetic faces, so the pieces don't even touch."

Mary was mesmerized. She pulled two cups off her chest area. "Image processing... oh! How do you solve the face shifting?"

"Super-transparency..." Mary murmured, holding the magnetic cups over her own chest. "This is giving me ideeeaas... Remember 'star mags'? Toys!?"

"It's perfect for children..." Jim was saying to Franzi nearby. "I picked up like a hundred meters of this stuff."

"What?" Jim noticed the silence. "Do you suddenly feel super heteronormative?"

"Heeheeheehee," Mary and Miwa giggled in the corner.

"So, how about that, uh... sports championship thingie?" Mary asked loudly.

"Packers won the superbowl!" Esteban cheered.

"Woo! Packers!" Jim fist-bumped him.

"Go Packerrrrs!" the girls laughed, holding hands.

***

Later, they were leaving.

"I'll bring over some cloth later, okay?" Jim called back.

"Sure!"

As they walked down the path, Mary stopped. She walked right into the side of the train car, pressing her face against the glass.

"Hey, Jim, I—"

"!" Jim turned. "What's wrong?"

"... I expected to be interrupted..." Mary muttered.

"So, what's left for you to do?" Jim asked.

"I'll look for Jack tomorrow so I'm done for today," Mary decided. "Then let's hang out!"

"Don't you need to plan a rainforest?"

"It's about a thousand hours of work..." Mary groaned, leaning against the train door.

"I know!"

"And you promised to do it in a week."

"I know!" Mary lunged at him.

*FWAK.*

Their heads collided.

"Ah- ow!" Mary cried out. But in the confusion of the impact, she grabbed his face and kissed him.

She pulled back immediately. "Wake up! Ack!"

She yanked him by the hair toward the waiting rail car. *Vrrrrrrrr.*

## **Chapter 3: TANK**

The image was stark: a heavy, rusted tank, half-buried in the marshy water. Giant centipedes crawled over its rotting hull.

***

"She shot me in the ass!" Mary shouted at the sky.

They were walking through the wilderness. The sun was high and hot.

"Haha- but it only affects octopi..." Jim laughed.

"It's still a needle in my butt!" Mary yelled, blushing furious red. "Why did you build a robot with such bad telemetry?!"

"Ha ha ha..."

"Where would you prefer to have been hit?" Jim asked, grinning.

"Haah?" Mary swung her leg up and kicked him. *Whap.*

"Where would you prefer me to kick you? Huh? Ha ha ha!"

They ran through the fields, laughing.

They came upon a large, dilapidated structure. It was an old factory or warehouse, its walls crumbling.

"Hey! It's our old fort!" Mary pointed. "It's been, what, six years?"

"Don't go in, it's falling apart," Jim warned.

"I'm visiting my billboard!" Mary declared, ignoring him.

They climbed to the roof. A massive, faded sign lay angled against the sky: *find everything in METROPOLIS*.

"Well, it still looks stable..." Mary grabbed the iron rungs of a maintenance ladder. *Yank yank.*

"Sure, let's go for it!"

"Yeah! You first, of course," Jim gestured.

"Fine!"

Mary began to climb. Halfway up, she looked down. Jim was right below her.

"Turn away!" she shrieked.

"Huh?"

"I don't want you to see my underwear yet!"

Jim looked up, face flushing. "I mean 'at all'! I mean 'ever'!" she corrected quickly.

"Hahaha!"

They reached the top platform, a metal grate overlooking the world.

"Okay!" Mary scrambled onto the grating. "Ah... home..."

She patted her dress. *Poof.* A massive cloud of ancient dust exploded from the fabric.

"GAK!" Jim coughed, waving his hands. *Paff paff.*

They sat on the edge of the platform, legs dangling. Jim took out a handkerchief and wiped the dirt from Mary's face.

"Do you remember Metropolis?" he asked softly.

"Of course," Mary said, leaning into his hand.

"We spent so many great times in Central Park..."

"Because you always followed your brother when we played."

Mary blushed. "Those were great days."

Jim smiled, cleaning her hands now. "Yeah, you got filthy all the time then, too."

"Shut up."

"But you know... Today's been really great, too."

Mary looked at him, her heart pounding.

"Ah! There's Jack!" Mary suddenly stood up and saluted.

Below them, striding through the tall grass, was a centaur. Not a mythical one, but Jack, riding a robotic horse body that replaced his legs.

"Heyyyyy," Mary called down.

"What the hell are you doing up there?" Jack yelled back.

"Are you crazy? Do you think you're a crane robot?" Mary shouted. "Geh."

Jim stared down, bewildered. "... are you riding a robot horse?"

"Haha, he looks so embarrassed!" Mary laughed. "Don't make fun, Mary."

"Sometimes, folks gotta be true to their roots," Jack said defensively. "Even if it looks pretentious."

"Don't be egotistical, you're not interesting enough to be pretentious," Mary shot back.

Jack paused. "... Good one." He tipped his hat. *Fwik.*

Mary pumped her fist in the air. "I did it! I finally got a 'good one'!"

She stomped her foot in victory.

*WHANGgg.*

The metal platform shuddered. *Rattle.*

*CRACK.*

The bolts securing the ladder to the wall sheared off. The entire structure groaned and pulled away from the building.

"and everything in ME" the sign seemed to mock them as the wall crumbled.

*PANG PANG CRACK.*

Jim lunged, grabbing Mary around the waist as the floor dropped out from under them.

"Down now?" he asked, his voice tight.

"Yeah."

They scrambled down the collapsing structure, landing in a heap in the grass.

Jack loomed over them on his robot horse. "Idiot."

"Scaaary..." Mary whimpered, clinging to Jim.

"How the fuck have you survived this long with a brain made of LINE NOISE?" Jack roared, his shadow stretching over them.

"Sorry, I got caught up in the moment..." Jim said.

"I'm sorry, it's all my fault!" Mary cried.

"I KNOW IT'S YOUR FAULT, YOU ST—" Jack started to yell, then stopped. He looked at the two of them, huddled together in the dirt.

"..." His expression softened. "Be more careful."

Jim stood up, brushing himself off. "Did you need me for something?"

"I need some heavy transport for tomorrow, out to the rail station," Jack said, all business again. "Warehouse five? 08:00?"

"Yeah, good."

Jack turned his mechanical mount and trotted away. He patted his chest, where a mechanical arm was now visible under his shirt. "Crazy bastard," he muttered.

***

Mary was wandering near the treeline, kicking at the dirt. She stopped, peering down.

"What is..." She pinched something in the grass. It was a strand of synthetic muscle fiber.

*Flashback.*

A younger Mary with an afro lay in the grass, blowing a dandelion. "If you show me yours, I'll show you mine," a voice said.

"Okay. One, two—"

Mary lifted her shirt. The robot boy lifted his chest plate.

"Oh! A rhinoceros beetle!" the robot boy exclaimed, holding the bug.

"I just have a lightning bug..." Mary said, disappointed.

"Hee hee hee."

"I ain't got one!" another boy teased.

"Shut up, pervert!" Mary yelled.

*Present Day.*

"Why is it so BORING all the time?" Mary shouted, stomping through the underbrush.

*KANG.*

Her foot caught on something hard.

"WHUMP." She faceplanted into the mud.

"Oo, panties!" the robot boy (Jim?) commented.

"Are you okay?"

"SHUT UP! It wasn't a tree root! It was metal!" Mary screamed, face still in the dirt.

They dug. Hands clawed at the mud, revealing a curved metal surface.

"Are you sure you should be digging? You're precision-type," the robot boy asked the robot girl.

"I'll get my new body in two days. I'm not worried."

"What IS this?" Mary asked, wiping sludge from a metal plate.

"It's a spider tank," the robot boy said.

"Let's go find Jack."

***

"You looked up my dress in the panic," Mary said as they walked back down the road.

"Of course," Jim replied shamelessly.

*KUNK.*

Mary swung her boot back and kicked him squarely in the shin.

"GYARRG!" Jim hopped on one foot, clutching his leg.

"Ah! I forgot I'm wearing steeltoes!" Mary gasped, covering her mouth.

"Well OW! Idiot."

"Kick me in the shin, OK? Hard!" Mary offered, sitting down.

"That would be... counterproductive."

"Well, I gotta make it up to you somehow!" Mary crawled over to him. She pressed her lips to his bruised shin. *Mwah.*

Jim blushed. "Meh, don't worry about it."

"There, oldschool comfort!"

"It actually feels a lot better! Really?!"

"Yeah, but now I'm feeling the kicks to my chest. Those cleats hurt!" Jim rubbed his chest.

"They're just rubber!"

"... but now I'm feeling your first kick..." Jim murmured, looking at her. "To my butt!"

Mary turned bright red. She scrambled up and ran toward the others.

"Heyyyy!"

Gretel, the robot girl, came bounding toward them in huge, hydraulic leaps. "I'll catch Jack!"

She landed in front of them. "Bueh, we found—haah—"

"Cool down, take it easy," Jim said.

"We found a buried spider tank."

***

The excavation site was loud with the sound of engines. Heavy diggers scooped earth away from the massive machine.

"Not surprised there's a tank here, with all the XVT cleanup we did," Jack said, smoking a cigarette in the cab of his vehicle.

"We're getting paid, right?" a worker asked.

"Whine whine whine."

Mary and the others climbed onto the exposed hull.

"Is it alive?" a child asked.

"Haha, don't be sill—" Jim started, then stopped. "Phew! Better be safe and check."

He plugged a device into a port. *KZARK.*

"So muddy..."

Red lights flickered deep under the grime. *SPLORP.*

"It's long dead. Just indicator lights left."

Gretel stepped onto a soft patch. *SPLUT.* A thick, grey goo oozed around her boot.

"Hey, what's XVT?" she asked.

"...you don't know?" Mary asked, horrified. "Are you joking?"

"Hey, leave it. It's fine if he doesn't know," Jack called out.

"I wanna know!" Gretel insisted.

Jim sighed. "Well, it's a deadly chemical. H-hey, cut it out! C'mere a minute."

He looked seriously at the kids. "It ruptures cells so fast that people seem to melt. It never neutralizes, so if it gets in the groundwater... everything dies!"

"lovelovelove everything dies lovelovelove," the display on Jim's face flickered.

"...why would that be on a SCOUT TANK?" Mary whispered.

"Nothing else can kill bioweapons."

Mary looked at Jim. "You said you're a different person than ten years ago?"

"Yes, obviously."

"It's nice to meet you."

Jack walked over. "Hey, don't worry about it. This whole area is saturated in cleanup bacteria."

"I'll... um... talktoyoulater," Mary stammered, backing away.

Esteban loomed over her. "I can give you a ride home, chica."

"No, it's not even a kilometer."

"You sure? You look pretty red!"

"thanks I gottago." Mary fled.

***

## **Chapter 4: RAIN**

Rain poured down in sheets, turning the world grey.

Inside a containment tent, Jim sat on a crate, staring at the spider tank. He looked exhausted.

"Hey, Jim, you've been working on this tank for two days straight," Gretel said, peeking through the tent flap.

"Yeah, I'm trying to clean it out, but there's so much mud," Jim replied without looking up.

"Um, well... my birthday's tomorrow."

"Yeah. My house, 10:00. I was trying to finish this first."

"So, um, it's all ready?" Gretel asked anxiously.

Jim turned to her. "Of course. Your body's been ready for *weeks*."

"I wouldn't leave something so important to the last minute!" He smiled tiredly. "Listen, I already finished Esteban's kid."

"... I'm really relieved," Gretel said, shoulders sagging.

"Robot bodies are my thing. Don't worry, it's done, it's perfect."
