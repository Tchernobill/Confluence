### **Critical Analysis Notes**

1.  **Kyr4n & Evilisa:**
    *   **Kyr4n -> Evilisa [1,-2,-2,3,2]:** He has a toxic affinity for her (comfort), distrusts her intent, is manipulated by her (negative power), experiences high volatility, but is drawn to her.
    *   **Evilisa -> Kyr4n [3,-1,-2,3,3]:** She "loves" him obsessively, distrusts his healing, relies on him for existence (negative power), and is highly unstable.
    *   **Everyone Else -> Evilisa:** Zero vectors. She is invisible to them.
    *   **Evilisa -> Everyone Else:** High negative affinity and trust (jealousy), but zero power to affect them directly.

2.  **The Love Triad (Kyr4n, Isa, Zara):**
    *   **Zara -> Isa [2,3,0,2,2]:** Evolved from rivalry to high trust and attraction (polyamorous dynamic), though Volatility remains (2) due to conflicting protection styles.
    *   **Isa -> Zara [2,3,0,2,2]:** Mirrors Zara; high trust, distinct sexual/romantic attraction in later arcs.
    *   **Kyr4n -> Both:** High scores across the board.

3.  **The Ideological Conflicts:**
    *   **Nat vs. Alex:** Nat (Bureaucrat) views Alex (Military) as a resource drain. **Nat -> Alex [-2,1,1,2,-1]** indicates dislike, low trust, belief she *should* control him (Power1), and friction (Volatility2).
    *   **Sedh vs. Kyr4n:** Sedh loves Kyr4n (+3 Affinity) but opposes his methods (Volatility2). Sedh perceives himself as having equal standing (Power0).

4.  **The Outsiders:**
    *   **Mat:** High Power scores *against* him from the organization members (they can crush him), low Trust from him towards them. He has intellectual attraction (+2) to Jin and Kyr4n (as puzzles).
    *   **Aurelio:** He bores Marcus (**Marcus -> Aurelio [-1] Affinity**), but fascinates Kyr4n.

5.  **Riley:**
    *   Scores represent his state pre-death or his lingering memory. He had high affinity with everyone he met, but0 interaction with later recruits (Aurelio, Kaia).
