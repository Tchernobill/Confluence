You can think of this as a "post-processing algorithm" to run on your writing after you finish a draft.

### 1. The "Direct Feed" Protocol (Kill Filter Words)

**The Rule:** Eliminate words that remind the reader they are observing a character. When you say "he saw," you put a camera between the reader and the action. When you remove it, the reader _becomes_ the character.

- **Trigger Words to Cut:** _Saw, heard, felt, noticed, realized, decided, wondered, knew._
    
- **Draft:** _Zara **saw** the drone hovering above. She **felt** the wind bite her face. She **knew** it was time to move._
    
- **Polished:** _The drone hovered above, lenses clicking. The wind bit her face. Time to move._
    

### 2. The "Specifics over Generics" Rule

**The Rule:** General nouns create blurry images. Specific nouns create high-definition images. Never use a category when you can use an item.

- **Draft:** _He drank some **alcohol** and checked his **weapon**._
    
- **Polished:** _He downed a shot of **synthetic gin** and checked the charge on his **Militech pistol**._
    
- **Why:** "Weapon" forces the reader to guess what it looks like. "Militech pistol" gives a specific shape, weight, and implied sound.
    

### 3. The "Strong Verb" Mandate (Adverb Execution)

**The Rule:** Adverbs (words ending in -ly) are often crutches for weak verbs. If you have to modify a verb to make it strong, find a better verb.

- **Draft:** _Marcus **closed the door firmly** and **looked angrily** at the intruder._
    
- **Polished:** _Marcus **slammed** the door and **glared** at the intruder._
    
- **Exception:** Use adverbs only when the action contradicts the verb (e.g., "He smiled sadly").
    

### 4. The Action Beat Replacement

**The Rule:** Avoid "said" when possible. Instead, use an "action beat"—a sentence describing what the character is doing physically while they speak. This grounds the dialogue in the physical world.

- **Draft:** _"I don't trust him," Zara **said suspiciously**._
    
- **Polished:** _Zara **thumbed the safety off her rifle.** "I don't trust him."_
    
- **Why:** This accomplishes two things: it tells us who is speaking, and it shows us their emotional state (distrust/readiness) without needing to label it.
    

### 5. Worldbuilding via Osmosis

**The Rule:** Never pause the story to describe the setting. Describe the setting _as the character interacts with it._

- **Draft:** _The street was dirty. There was neon everywhere. It was raining._
    
- **Polished:** _His boots **squelched** through the neon-reflected sludge of the gutter._
    
- **Why:** In the polished version, the dirt, neon, and rain are all present, but the character is moving _through_ them rather than stopping to look at them.
    

### 6. The "Tactical" Variety Check

**The Rule:** In genre fiction (Cyberpunk, Fantasy, Sci-Fi), we tend to fall in love with certain cool words (e.g., _tactical, quantum, cybernetic, dark_). If you use a "cool" word three times in one page, it stops being cool.

- **The Fix:** use a thesaurus or rephrase.
    
    - _Tactical_ → Strategic, combat-ready, calculated, kinetic.
        
    - _Cybernetic_ → Chrome, augmented, wired, synthetic.
        

### 7. Rhythm Control (Sentence Length)

**The Rule:** Sentence length dictates the heart rate of the reader.

- **Action/Tension:** Short, punchy sentences. Fragments.
    
- **Description/Calm:** Long, flowing, complex sentences.
    
- **Draft (Monotone):** _The explosion happened and he fell back. He hit the wall hard. He tried to stand up but he couldn't._
    
- **Polished (Rhythmic):** _The explosion threw him back. He hit the wall. Hard. He tried to stand. Failed._

### Your "Search and Destroy" Checklist

When you are editing your next piece, do a "Find" (Ctrl+F) for these words. If you find them, rewrite the sentence to remove them.

1. **"There was / There were"** → Passive. Make something _exist_ actively.
    
    - _Bad:_ There was a smell of ozone.
        
    - _Good:_ The air smelled of ozone.
        
2. **"Suddenly"** → If it happens suddenly, just say it. The word "suddenly" actually slows down the surprise.
    
    - _Bad:_ Suddenly, the glass broke.
        
    - _Good:_ The glass shattered.
        
3. **"Seemed / Appeared"** → Unless the character is hallucinating, just say what it is.
    
    - _Bad:_ He seemed angry.
        
    - _Good:_ His jaw clenched.
