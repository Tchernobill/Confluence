# Timeline: From First Threshold to Phoenix Recovery Establishment

## Week 1: The Uncomfortable Transition (Aug 27 - Sep 3)

**2108-08-27** - **First Threshold**

- Evening: Isa brings Kyr4n to her container unit for the first time
- Night: First night sleeping at her place (intimate scene as written)
- **Kyr4n's state:** Overwhelmed but hopeful, willing to try

**2108-08-28** - **Day 1 at Isa's**

- Morning: Kyr4n wakes disoriented by unfamiliar sounds (children playing, neighbors talking through walls, footsteps on metal walkways)
- Day: Isa goes to work in her showroom; Kyr4n feels awkward lingering in her living space
- Evening: Attempts to work on Sedh's components but worried about cluttering her space
- Night: Struggles to sleep; Stack noises too persistent (humming of structure, distant music, people moving at all hours)

**2108-08-29 to 2108-08-31** - **Days 2-4**

- Kyr4n increasingly restless, not sleeping well
- Starts leaving early, wandering the Stack or returning to his utility room to work
- Isa notices but doesn't push, giving him space
- He feels guilty—she's offering him so much and he can't settle
- Torn between wanting to be with her and needing his own space to work/think/breathe

**2108-09-01 to 2108-09-02** - **Weekend (Days 5-6)**

- Kyr4n barely sleeping, dark circles forming
- Spends hours just holding Sedh's components, unable to focus on work at Isa's
- Saturday night: Admits to Isa he's struggling with the noise, the feeling of invading her space
- She reassures him but can see it's not working
- Sunday: Isa thoughtful, clearly considering something

**2108-09-03** - **Day 7 - Isa Consults Riley**

- Morning: Isa tells Kyr4n she has some business to handle, kisses him, leaves
- Afternoon: Isa meets with Riley at a neutral location (market level cafe)
- They discuss Kyr4n's situation—he needs space to work, needs quiet, needs purpose
- Riley mentions knowing someone with empty container space in lower-density area
- They begin forming a plan: legitimate business front, workspace for Kyr4n, living space for Riley
- Evening: Isa returns, seems lighter, but doesn't explain yet

## Week 2: Phoenix Rising (Sep 4-6)

**2108-09-04** - **The Errand**

- Morning: Isa asks Kyr4n to come with her on an "errand"
- Mid-morning: They travel to edge of territory, lower density area, fewer Stacks
- Location: More spread out, quieter, some standalone container structures
- They meet **[Name TBD - property owner]** - older man, somewhat gruff but fair
- Isa asks about "available space" while Kyr4n looks confused
- Riley arrives (clearly planned), greets them both
- The man leads them inside: **3 adjacent shipping containers**, currently empty
    - First container: Could be workshop/repair area
    - Second container: Could be office/customer area
    - Third container: Could be living quarters
- Much quieter than the Stacks—ground level, some distance from neighbors
- Isa and Riley exchange looks; Riley asks about terms
- The man names a price (reasonable for the area)
- **Isa to Kyr4n:** "What do you think? For the business. Phoenix Recovery."
- Kyr4n realizes: they planned this. For him. For all of them.
- **The Birth of Phoenix Recovery** - they agree to terms
- Afternoon: Riley and Isa explain the vision—legitimate repair business, Kyr4n's technical skills, Riley's courier connections, Isa's implant dealer network
- Evening: Return to Isa's place, Kyr4n overwhelmed but in a good way

**2108-09-05** - **Moving In (Phoenix Recovery)**

- Morning: Kyr4n returns to his utility room to gather tools, equipment, Sedh's components
- Midday: Riley helps move his salvaged workbench and equipment to Phoenix Recovery
- Afternoon: Begin basic setup—establishing workspace in first container
- Evening: Riley moves personal items into third container (living quarters)
- Night: Kyr4n works late setting up, Riley crashes in the living space
- **Kyr4n stays the night** at Phoenix Recovery for the first time—blessed quiet, space to work

**2108-09-06** - **First Full Day**

- Morning: Both wake at Phoenix Recovery, begin establishing routines
- Day: Continue setting up workshop, Riley starts spreading word through courier network
- Evening: Isa visits, brings food, stays for dinner
- Night: Isa returns to her place; Kyr4n stays at Phoenix Recovery
- He finally sleeps well—quiet location, his own space, purpose

## Establishing the Pattern (Sep 7-14)

**2108-09-07 to 2108-09-13** - **First Week of Operations**

- Days: Kyr4n and Riley establish Phoenix Recovery operations
- Kyr4n works on repairs, works on Sedh in his own dedicated space
- Riley handles customer relations, deliveries, networking
- Isa visits regularly, sometimes stays for dinner, occasionally overnight
- Nights: Kyr4n usually sleeps at Phoenix Recovery (quiet, workspace nearby)
- But he visits Isa several times—their relationship continues, just with more space
- By end of week: Comfortable rhythm established—he has workspace/living space, but also has Isa

**2108-09-14 Evening** - **Visit to Isa's**

- Kyr4n visits Isa at her container unit
- They have dinner, spend the evening together
- He stays the night (now comfortable because he _chose_ to come, not because he has nowhere else)
- This leads into **"Quiet Hours"** scene

**2108-09-15 02:00** - **Quiet Hours**

- The scene as written
- They're comfortable together now because:
    - He has his own space (Phoenix Recovery)
    - He can visit her by choice, not necessity
    - The pressure of "living together" is gone
    - They can enjoy intimacy without the stress of forced cohabitation

## Notes for Scene Development

**Scenes that could be written:**

1. **"Sleepless in the Stacks"** (Sep 1-2) - Kyr4n's growing discomfort, Isa noticing
2. **"The Consultation"** (Sep 3) - Isa and Riley planning Phoenix Recovery
3. **"The Errand"** (Sep 4) - Finding the space, the reveal, the birth of Phoenix Recovery
4. **"First Night at Phoenix"** (Sep 5) - Kyr4n finally sleeping in quiet
5. **"Establishing Rhythm"** (Sep 7-13) - Montage of them building the business and new relationship dynamic

This timeline allows:

- Natural progression from "trying to live together" to "finding what works"
- Establishment of Phoenix Recovery as practical solution
- Maintains Isa/Kyr4n intimacy while giving him the space he needs
- Sets up Riley as important third character
- Leads naturally into "Quiet Hours" where they're comfortable because the pressure is off
