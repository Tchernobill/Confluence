# Relationship Evolution Arc – Tome 1 & 2 (Revised: DarkNight Infection Arc)

### Characters
- **Kyr4n** — introverted scavenger / repair prodigy; analytical, emotionally repressed, later infected by DarkNight nanovirus causing paranoia and self-destructive decline.  
- **Isa** — implant dealer; pragmatic, charismatic, fiercely loyal, later driven to leave when Kyr4n’s fear of her becomes unbearable.  
- **Riley** — older courier; grounded, empathetic, remains Kyr4n’s link to normalcy after Isa’s departure.

---

## 1. Overview
The relationship begins as a gradual interconnection of three solitary survivors—forming warmth and trust out of chaos.  
During Tome 2, the DarkNight infection corrupts that foundation, shifting tone from emotional security to disintegration.  
Kyr4n’s breakdown and Isa’s withdrawal end the triad’s stability, leaving Riley the last bridge between what was and what might be rebuilt.
