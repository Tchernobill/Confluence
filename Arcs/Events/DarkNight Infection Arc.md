# 🜸 DarkNight Infection Arc  
**Tome:** 2  
**Timeline:** ⅓ into Tome 2 → End of Tome 2  
**Keywords:** Kyr4n, Isa, Riley, Mira, Sedh, ProximaTech Labs, TMP-7734  
**Theme:** Corruption of trust, psychological warfare, descent and recovery

---

## I. Overview
The **DarkNight Infection Arc** marks the psychological and emotional collapse of Kyr4n, following a covert infection by the nanoviral psychological warfare system **TMP-7734** (codename **[[DarkNight]]**).  
This arc serves as the **central fracture point** of the trio’s dynamic, leading to Isa’s departure, Riley’s isolation, and Kyr4n’s trauma that echoes through later tomes.

---

## II. Infection Event
**Location:** ProximaTech Labs (Black Sector)  
**Trigger:** High-risk raid to salvage restricted AI cores and neural augment prototypes.  
**Incident:** Kyr4n suffers micro-lacerations from a damaged containment pod marked *TMP-7734*.  
**Immediate Outcome:**  
- No visible symptoms for days.  
- Mission declared successful; Kyr4n hides minor injuries.  
- Infection remains undetected.

---

## III. Symptom Onset
**Timeframe:** Weeks after the ProximaTech raid (Tome 2, mid).  
**Progression:**  
- **Behavioural:** Irritability, insomnia, social withdrawal.  
- **Cognitive:** Paranoia, auditory distortions, false memories.  
- **Emotional:** Fear of Isa’s motives; distrust of Sedh’s data; guilt toward Riley.  
- **Physical:** Tremors, headaches, derealization.  

**Observation:** Both Isa and Riley misattribute the symptoms to burnout and overwork from Kyr4n’s obsessive rebuilding projects.

---

## IV. Collapse and Revelation
**Event:** Mental breakdown → suicide attempt → emergency intervention.  
**Result:** Kyr4n placed in **medical coma** under Mira’s supervision.  

### Discovery
- Mira scans neural patterns → detects unknown nanobot lattice.  
- Data tag retrieved: `TMP-7734`.  

### Isa’s Response
- Overcome by worries and urgency, Isa posts an encrypted bounty for information on TMP-7734.  
- Contacts darknet intermediaries and abandoned corp-net nodes.  
- Receives a **data package** containing partial Lazarus backdoor architecture.

---

## V. The Lazarus Protocol
**Primary Actors:** Isa, Mira, Sedh  
**Procedure:**  
1. **Mira** isolates Kyr4n’s neural signature to identify C2 frequency (within 0.1–4 Hz).  
2. **Sedh** utilizes adaptive AI pattern recognition to decrypt part of the backdoor.  
3. Combined effort locates **Lazarus Access Point** within Kyr4n’s amygdala cluster.  
4. Override initiated through Isa’s neural link → partial shutdown of DarkNight nanonet.  

**Result:**
- DarkNight neutralized; host (Kyr4n) stabilized.  
- Neural scarring persists—embedded traumatic patterns remain in subconscious.  

---

## VI. Aftermath
**Kyr4n’s Condition:**  
- Physically stable, but emotionally fractured.  
- Recurring nightmares depicting Isa as tormentor—virus-induced false memories.  
- Avoids physical or emotional proximity to Isa.  

**Isa’s Arc:**  
- Attempts to reconnect fail.  
- Leaves the South Shore Slum, ignoring all contact attempts.  

**Riley’s Arc:**  
- Remains quietly loyal, continuing occasional visits.  
- Becomes Kyr4n’s last emotional link to humanity.  

**Mira & Sedh:**  
- Document DarkNight case for internal study (classified).  
- Develop countermeasures for neural-level infections (precursor to Tome 3 tech arc).

## VII. Technical Reference – DarkNight (TMP-7734)
**Source:** ProximaTech Labs (classified project “Midnight Protocol”)  
**Nature:** Nano-viral neural infiltrator designed for psychological warfare.  
**Phases:**  
1. **Reconnaissance** – Neural mapping  
2. **Profiling** – Fear-matrix construction  
3. **Manipulation** – Hallucinatory domination  

**Command Nodes:** Amygdala (Primary), Cortex, Hippocampus  
**Effect:** Paranoia, perception distortion, fear hallucination, social isolation  
**Countermeasure:** Lazarus Backdoor (unique per instance; decrypted manually)  
**Status:** Neutralized in Kyr4n’s case; origin unresolved.

## VIII. Narrative Function
| **Aspect** | **Purpose** |
|-------------|-------------|
| Infection | Physical manifestation of psychological decay. |
| Breakdown | Catalyst for Isa’s departure and the triad’s dissolution. |
| Lazarus Backdoor | Symbol of hope born from intellect and connection. |
| Aftermath | Seeds the long-term trauma arc leading to Tome 5 reunion. |
