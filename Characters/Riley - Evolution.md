## Meta Notes

### Character Arc Strengths
- Organic relationship development without forced drama
- Death feels earned and meaningful, not cheap
- Clear symbolic purpose without being obvious
- Consistent voice and values throughout
- Perfect timing for maximum impact

### Character Arc Weaknesses
- Could use more screen time in Arc 1-2 to build investment
- His internal conflict (freedom vs. connection) could be explored deeper
- Might benefit from one scene showing his own fears about the danger
- Could show more of his courier work/skills to establish competence

### Writing Notes

**Key Moments to Emphasize:**
- First casual meeting with Kyr4n (establishes dynamic)
- Teaching meditation scene (establishes mentor role)
- Final compound visit before kidnapping (foreshadowing)
- The execution itself (should be brutal and sudden)
- Kyr4n's reaction (should be devastating)

**Dialogue Reminders:**
- Always relaxed, unhurried speech pattern
- Uses travel metaphors naturally
- Meditation/breathing references when others stressed
- Never lectures, always suggests
- "Friend" as casual address to close people

**Scene Placement:**
- Space Riley scenes for maximum grounding effect
- Use him after intense action/drama
- Final appearance should feel normal before kidnapping
- Execution should interrupt mid-speech for brutality

### Inspiration & References

**Character Arc Inspiration:**
- The mentor who dies to push hero forward (but subverted - this breaks rather than motivates)
- Innocent victim of protagonist's choices (Spider-Man's uncle, but friend not family)
- The wise wanderer archetype (but younger and more active)

**Thematic References:**
- Buddhist philosophy of non-attachment (he teaches but can't save friend)
- Road movies and courier fiction (freedom through movement)
- Cyberpunk innocent casualties (system grinds up the good)
