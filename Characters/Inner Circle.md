**Emotional Comfort Overreach:**
- When providing care during his vulnerable moments, offering more physical comfort than strictly medical
- Staying closer than necessary during treatment because he seems to find her presence soothing

**"Medical" Justifications for Personal Contact:**
- Occasionally prescribing therapeutic massage or relaxation techniques that involve extended physical contact
- "His stress levels require hands-on intervention" (mostly true, but she could recommend others)

**Information Advantage:**
- Sometimes not immediately sharing minor medical information if it means he'll need to continue relying on her care
- Not urgent enough to be harmful, but she enjoys being indispensable during recovery periods

### Sample Dialogue

**Professional with Hints of Personal:**
- "Your stress levels are elevated again. Let me... take care of this properly." (slight pause reveals personal motivation)
- "The enhanced metabolism requires very specific care. I should monitor this personally."
- "This treatment works best with direct application. Trust me." (professional truth with personal satisfaction)

**Moment of Guilt/Awareness:**
- "I... that examination was more thorough than strictly necessary. My apologies."
- "Sometimes I worry I'm not maintaining proper professional distance. You deserve better care standards."
- "I should probably recommend another physician for this, but... you respond better to familiar treatment."

**Rationalization:**
- "Enhanced individuals require enhanced care protocols. Standard boundaries don't always apply."
- "Medical best practices sometimes conflict with textbook ethics in unique circumstances."
- "His trust in my care produces better medical outcomes than strict procedural adherence would."
