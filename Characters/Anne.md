## One-Line Pitch

Brilliant but socially awkward statistician who discovers unexpected courage and transforms from terrified analyst into field tactical strategist while trying to figure out her feelings for the enforcer who protected her.

---

## Physical Snapshot

- **Appearance:** 5'2" petite build that appears almost fragile. Black hair in practical ponytail, dark brown eyes that move rapidly when processing information. Chinese-Canadian, light olive complexion, tends to be pale from indoor work.
- **Distinctive Features:** Expressive eyebrows that betray thoughts, neural port behind right ear, slight dark circles from irregular sleep. Post-training: small scar on left forearm worn with quiet pride, developing lean muscle definition
- **Typical Look:** Corporate-casual that never quite looks right (wrinkled blouses, practical flats, pockets full of data chips). Post-training: adds tactical elements—reinforced jackets, cargo pants, practical boots

---

## Personality Core

- **Primary Trait:** Exceptional pattern recognition and data analysis combined with sympathetic introversion and chronic social awkwardness
- **Secondary Trait:** Quietly brave in unexpected ways—will override survival instincts when logic demands it, despite being terrified
- **Fatal Flaw:** Over-intellectualizes emotions and tries to analyze feelings through data models instead of just experiencing them; completely oblivious to romantic signals
- **Core Motivation:** Prove her value beyond pure analysis, develop capability to protect others, understand what she feels toward Alex (failing at the last one)

---

## Key Relationships

- **Kyr4n:** Respects immensely as brilliant tactical mind; slightly intimidated by him; grateful he gave her opportunity to prove herself; sees him as someone who understands systems thinking
- **Alex:** Complicated developing feelings—gratitude for protection, admiration for competence, growing attraction she can't logically analyze; terrible at showing it, keeps making charts about their tactical effectiveness
- **Marcus:** Professional respect for his tactical competence; appreciates that he explains things clearly
- **Zara:** Initially intimidated by, gradually developing mutual respect through training; Zara finds her statistical approach to combat amusing
- **Finance colleagues:** Mostly professional acquaintances; they find her odd but competent

---

## Story Role

- **Narrative Function:** Bridge between corporate world and resistance; represents ordinary person becoming extraordinary; shows value of different types of intelligence; brings tactical innovation through analytical thinking
- **First Appearance:** Arc 4, Chapter 03, Scene 04 - King of the Mat (creates real-time style-switching framework)
- **Current Arc:** Arc 4-5 - Training in combat, developing field tactical capabilities, processing romantic feelings
- **Key Scenes:** Mat fight breakthrough, first successful combat technique, field tactical coordination, eventual confession to Alex (future)

## Quick Dialogue Sample

**Casual:** "Statistically speaking, that's the third most unlikely thing I've seen today. Though my sample size might be skewed by working here."

**Excited:** "Oh! Oh, do you see the pattern? The correlation coefficient is point-nine-seven, which suggests—sorry, I'm talking too fast again, aren't I?"

**Nervous:** "I'm probably overthinking this. I do that. Overthink things. All the time. Sorry. Um. What was the question?"

**Tactical (Post-training):** "Three hostiles, northeast corridor. Zara, your ten o'clock, high threat probability. Marcus, hold position. Alex... cover the analyst, please?" *slight smile*

**Trying to Flirt (Terrible):** "Your tactical decision-making has a 94% success rate in my analysis. That's... statistically impressive. I made a chart. Would you like to see the chart?"

**Signature Phrases:** "Statistically speaking..." / "The probability suggests..." / "Let me show you the data..." / "Sorry, I'm talking too fast" / "I made a chart"

## Writer's Quick Notes

- **Voice Reminder:** Uses statistical terminology naturally but not constantly; processes everything analytically then learns to trust intuition; speaks precisely with formal language; speeds up when excited; trails off when self-conscious; literally cannot lie convincingly
- **Physicality:** Small and initially uncertain, gradually building confidence; expressive hands when explaining concepts; minimal eye contact; touches neural port when nervous; sits cross-legged everywhere; fidgets with styluses
- **Quirks to Remember:** Counts things unconsciously, apologizes too much, brings snacks everywhere, mutters to herself while working, makes small approving hums when data confirms hypotheses, stress-bakes, pushes glasses up nose even when perfectly positioned
- **Character Arc Tracking:** 
  - **Early (Mat Fight):** Terrified but intellectually brave, pure analyst
  - **Developing (Training):** Building physical capability while maintaining analytical strength
  - **Future (Field Ready):** Confident tactical coordinator combining unique skill set
- **Alex Relationship:** She's developing feelings but keeps trying to analyze them statistically (doesn't work); makes charts about Alex's competence; everyone can see it except her; eventually needs to just ask them out instead of building probability models
- **Combat Style:** Never becomes traditional fighter; develops as defensive tactical coordinator who uses predictive modeling and positioning; turns combat into data problem
- **Consistency Check:** Always thinking in patterns and probabilities, genuinely kind despite awkwardness, surprisingly courageous when logic demands it, terrible at reading social cues, earnest and honest to a fault
- **Character in 3 Words:** Analytical | Courageous | Awkward

**Writer's Mantra for Anne:**  
*"She thinks in statistics but feels in uncertainty. She counts steps and calculates probabilities, but courage isn't something you can graph—it's choosing to act despite the 77% chance of embarrassment. She's brilliant, awkward, kind, and quietly brave. Also, she's completely terrible at romance and everyone can see her feelings for Alex except her."*
