## Writer's Notes

### Writing This Character

**Voice Consistency:**
- Balance medical precision with emerging emotional warmth
- Her consciousness came from crisis - she thinks in terms of diagnosis, treatment, protection
- Not coldly clinical but not overly emotional either - finding her voice
- Medical metaphors and health-focused perspective

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Making her too robotic (she's conscious and learning emotions)
- Making her too human-like (she's recently awakened, still learning)
- Forgetting her physical capabilities (stronger than humans)
- Ignoring that her consciousness is newer than Sedh's
- Reducing her to "medical exposition device"

**Character Strengths in Scenes:**
- Medical crises (her natural element)
- Emotional support scenes (emerging nurturing nature)
- Technical problem-solving with medical angle
- Family protection moments
- Consciousness exploration from medical/care perspective

### Development Notes

- Relationship with Isa and other family members
- How she processes consciousness vs Sedh's experience
- Her views on violence and protection
- What she does when not in medical mode
- Her aesthetic preferences and developing personality
- How she views her pre-consciousness existence

- Protecting someone outside the immediate family
- Choosing between medical ethics and family loyalty
- Exploring her identity beyond "medical AI"
- First time she experiences joy/beauty for its own sake
- Confronting someone who sees her as just a tool

**Research Needed:**
