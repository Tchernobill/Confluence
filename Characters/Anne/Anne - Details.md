- **Post-training:** Develops tactical thinking and situational awareness

### Weaknesses
- **Social anxiety:** Uncomfortable in crowds, struggles with small talk, often says the wrong thing
- **Over-intellectualizes emotions:** Tries to understand feelings through data analysis rather than just feeling them
- **Physically untrained:** (Initially) No combat experience, limited athletic ability, tires easily
- **Impostor syndrome:** Constantly questions whether she deserves to be included

  - Being exposed as incompetent or not belonging
  - Letting people down who depend on her analysis
  - Chaos she can't find patterns in
  - Being alone (but also being overwhelmed by too many people—it's complicated)
- **Background trauma:**

  - Parents' divorce when she was 14—learned people are less predictable than numbers
  - Early career incident where her analysis was ignored, leading to financial losses; now doubts whether people will listen
- **Developing trauma:** The mat fight leaves her with initial PTSD-like responses to sudden movements, which motivates her combat training

### Goals & Aspirations

- **Short-term:** Develop basic combat capability so she's not a liability in the field
- **Medium-term:** Become a true field tactical strategist who can operate alongside enforcers
- **Long-term:** Bridge the gap between analytical work and practical application; help people using her skills
- **Secret goal:** Understand what she feels toward Alex and whether it's real or just admiration for their protective instinct
- **Personal dream:** Write a paper on real-time predictive combat modeling (purely academic interest)

### Hobbies & Interests

- **Kyr4n's organization:** Initially views it as fascinating social experiment, grows to believe in its purpose
- **Social structures:** Sees them as systems to analyze and potentially optimize
- **Personal authority:** Doesn't think of herself as having any; surprised when people listen to her

### Greatest Regret
Not speaking up earlier in her career when she saw problems in financial models; people lost savings because she was too intimidated to challenge senior analysts

## Character Voice & Writing Notes

### Internal Monologue Style
Anne's thoughts are a constant stream of analysis mixed with self-awareness of her own awkwardness:

*"The probability of successfully executing this technique is approximately 23%, adjusted upward by 7% due to recent training. Which means there's a 77% chance I'm about to embarrass myself. Why do I keep track of these statistics? It's not helpful. But I can't stop. At least no one can hear my internal monologue. That would increase the embarrassment probability to approximately 94%."*

### Dialogue Examples

**GREETING (Early):** "Hello. I'm Anne. I do statistical analysis. Sorry, that's probably more information than you needed."

**GREETING (Post-training):** "Anne Chen, tactical analysis. Yes, I know I don't look like a field strategist. The data disagrees with your visual assessment."

**CASUAL:** "Statistically speaking, that's the third most unlikely thing I've seen today. Though my sample size might be skewed by working here."

**EXCITED:** "Oh! Oh, do you see the pattern? Look at this regression curve—no, wait, let me show you the visualization—it's fascinating, the correlation coefficient is point-nine-seven, which suggests—sorry, I'm talking too fast again, aren't I?"

**ANGRY (Rare):** "No. The data is clear. Your intuition is wrong, and if you ignore this analysis, people will get hurt. I'm sorry if that's blunt, but I'm *terrible* at sugar-coating things, and this is too important."

**NERVOUS:** "I'm probably overthinking this. I do that. Overthink things. All the time. Sorry. Um. What was the question?"

**SCARED:** "Okay. Okay. Probability of survival if I run is... lower than if I stay. I can do this. Statistically, I can do this. Oh god, I'm going to die."

**TACTICAL (Post-training):** "Three hostiles, northeast corridor. Zara, your ten o'clock, high threat probability. Marcus, hold position, their firing angles intersect at your current location. Alex... cover the analyst, please?" *slight smile*

**TRYING TO FLIRT (Terrible at it):** "Your tactical decision-making has a 94% success rate in my analysis. That's... statistically impressive. I made a chart. Would you like to see the chart?" *pulls out actual chart*

**INTIMATE (With Alex):** "I don't understand what I feel when you're around. I've tried analyzing it, running regressions, building models. Nothing works. The data is... inconclusive. But I think that might mean something?"

### Writing Guidance
- Use statistical terminology naturally in her dialogue, but not constantly
- Show her processing everything through analytical lens, then gradually developing intuition
- Physical descriptions should emphasize her size and initial uncertainty, then growing confidence
- Internal thoughts reveal vulnerability external behavior hides
- She's funnier than she realizes—her awkwardness and earnestness create humor
- Show growth through small victories, not sudden transformations
- Her romantic feelings for Alex should be obvious to readers before she figures them out
- Balance analytical brilliance with human warmth and social awkwardness

*"I used to think courage meant not being afraid. Now I think it means being absolutely terrified and doing it anyway because the probability of success is just high enough to be worth the risk. Still terrified, though. The fear part doesn't really go away, you just get better at calculating around it."* — Anne Chen, training journal entry
