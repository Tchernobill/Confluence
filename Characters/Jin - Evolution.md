## Writer's Development Notes

### Writing This Arc Successfully

**Key Challenges:**
- Showing redemption as earned through consistent work, not sudden transformation
- Balancing technical genius with social awkwardness without making him incompetent
- Making his guilt realistic without becoming wallowing or performative
- Showing emotional growth without losing core personality

**Voice Consistency Reminders:**
- Always technical metaphors even when discussing emotions
- Enthusiasm about work should remain constant—it's his genuine joy
- Social awkwardness shouldn't disappear—he improves but never becomes smooth
- Physical descriptions should emphasize small stature and workspace comfort

**Pacing Notes:**
- Early arcs: Show struggle and insecurity more prominently
- Mid arcs: Gradual confidence building through small successes
- Later arcs: Allow him competence while maintaining humility
- Don't rush romantic subplot—his emotional growth is slowest aspect

### Continuity Checks

**Cross-Arc Consistency:**
- [ ] Technical abilities remain consistent—he's always been brilliant
- [ ] Social awkwardness improves but never disappears completely
- [ ] Work obsession lessens but remains core trait
- [ ] Guilt over paralyzed client remains background presence
- [ ] Relationship with Kyr4n always shows deep respect
- [ ] Physical appearance stays consistent (scars, augmentations, work clothes)

**Common Continuity Risks:**
- Making him too socially competent too quickly
- Forgetting his physical vulnerability in action scenes
- Having him suddenly able to fight or handle conflict physically
- Losing his enthusiasm and technical joy in later arcs
- Making romantic relationship too easy—he should struggle

### Revision Planning

**Arc 1 Needs:**
- Add more detail about illegal clinic days in flashbacks
- Show arrogance more clearly so redemption arc has stronger contrast
- Develop the paralyzed client incident with full emotional weight
- Strengthen the moment of recruitment—should feel life-changing

**Arc 2-3 Needs:**
- Show more incremental successes building confidence
- Develop relationships with other inner circle members more
- Add scenes showing him teaching/mentoring to demonstrate growth
- Potential romantic subplot setup needs careful handling

**Arc 4-6 Needs:**
- Plan confrontation with paralyzed client carefully—keystone moment
- Develop romantic relationship as major growth catalyst
- Show him taking leadership without Kyr4n more prominently
- Create satisfying mentor moment where he helps someone like he was helped
