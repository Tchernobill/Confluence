---

## One-Line Pitch

A mysteriously aloof data archaeologist who treats information like literature and people like corrupted files, Mat walks the line between truth-seeker and chaos agent, never quite friend or enemy to anyone.

---

## Physical Snapshot

- **Appearance:** 5'8" with lean, wiry build that moves with casual grace. Light olive skin slightly pale from indoor lifestyle. Currently sporting electric blue hair (changes frequently), with dark brown eyes that shift between distant and calculating.
- **Distinctive Features:** Small scar through left eyebrow, geometric tattoos on forearms that function as data storage, callused fingertips from constant typing, neural interface jack hidden under hair
- **Typical Look:** Vintage band t-shirts, worn jeans, rotating collection of different jackets and hoodies, always wears fingerless gloves

---

## Personality Core

- **Primary Trait:** Mysteriously aloof with exceptional pattern recognition and casual brilliance
- **Secondary Trait:** Sardonic wit masking emotional guardedness and fierce independence
- **Fatal Flaw:** Commitment issues and tendency to disappear when relationships get complicated; emotional detachment can blind him to dangerous games he's playing
- **Core Motivation:** Uncover the "big truth" behind corporate information control while maintaining absolute personal freedom

---

## Key Relationships

- **Kyr4n's Organization:** Professional respect with occasional collaboration; intrigued by their security patterns and data needs. Wildcard status - neither friend nor enemy.
- **Helene:** Conflict during Arc 4 over the childhood documents investigation - she opposed approaching Kyr4n, but Mat pushed through anyway.
- **Phoenix Recovery:** Irregular contractor providing information services while maintaining professional distance and independence.
- **Corporate Family:** Distant and formal relationship; discovered their involvement in data manipulation schemes, leading to protective separation.
- **Information Broker Network:** Professional relationships built on mutual benefit and information trading.

---

## Story Role

- **Narrative Function:** Information provider, bridge between legitimate and criminal data worlds, outside investigator perspective trying to piece together mysteries (particularly Kyr4n's past)
- **First Appearance:** Arc 2+ (Recurring specialist contact)
- **Current Arc:** Arc 4 - Investigates Kyr4n's childhood, discovers contradictory documents
- **Key Scenes:** 
  - Early Arc 4: Investigation of Kyr4n's past, discovery of childhood documents
  - Arc 4: Conflict with Helene over approaching Kyr4n with findings
  - Arc 4: Confrontation with Kyr4n about documents (reveals wildcard nature)

---

## Quick Dialogue Sample

**Casual:** "Information wants to be free, but everyone has secrets worth keeping."  
**Stressed:** "Actually, I do have a better idea. Neural cascade override."  
**Under Pressure:** "Clean data extraction, minimal processing time. Catastrophic neural feedback."
**Signature Line:** "I've seen board meetings that would terrify dictators" / Quotes obscure data fragments as conversation

---

## Writer's Quick Notes

- **Voice Reminder:** Dry, sardonic tone with deadpan delivery; uses technical metaphors casually; speaks in blunt technical assessments; becomes genuinely enthusiastic only about information puzzles
- **Consistency Check:** Mat is a WILDCARD - not friend or enemy with Kyr4n or the organization. He digs for truth but may not understand the dangerous game he's playing. Some truths are weaponized disinformation.
- **Character in 3 Words:** Aloof | Brilliant | Elusive

---

## Wildcard Status Note

**CRITICAL:** Mat is neither ally nor enemy to Kyr4n's organization. He operates by his own moral code ("information wants to be free, but everyone has secrets worth keeping"). His investigation into Kyr4n's past demonstrates both his persistence and his potential naivety about the dangers of the information game. When he brings documents suggesting Kyr4n's father is a corporate executive or that Kyr4n had genetic modifications, Kyr4n dismisses them as fabrications and theorizes they're an elaborate trap - showing Mat as someone who finds truth but may miss the bigger picture of information warfare.
