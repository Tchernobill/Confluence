## Writer's Development Notes

### Writing This Arc Successfully

**Key Challenges:**
- Showing growth without destroying his core independence - balance is critical
- Making Arc 4 humbling without breaking him completely - wound but don't destroy
- Demonstrating emotional growth in character who's intellectually brilliant but emotionally stunted - gradual, realistic progression
- Maintaining wildcard status while developing connections - neither fully ally nor enemy

**Voice Consistency Reminders:**
- Keep sardonic humor even as he grows - it's core to his character
- Technical metaphors should continue throughout - his primary language
- Show emotional growth through actions more than words - he's not suddenly articulate about feelings
- Maintain occasional appearances changes when stressed - physical manifestation of internal state

**Pacing Notes:**
- Arc 2-3: Slow build of professional relationships and investigation obsession
- Arc 4: Sharp, concentrated crisis that forces change
- Arc 5: Moderate pace of processing and learning
- Arc 6: Settled integration showing sustainable change

### Continuity Checks

**Cross-Arc Consistency:**
- [x] Personality changes are logical and motivated (Arc 4 crisis drives growth)
- [x] Skills progress realistically (information warfare understanding develops gradually)
- [x] Relationships evolve believably (Helene conflict to respect over time)
- [x] Physical appearance changes tracked (hair color shifts with stress)
- [x] Timeline makes sense (ages 27-32 over six arcs)
- [x] Motivations remain clear (freedom + truth-seeking, with growing wisdom about both)

**Common Continuity Risks:**
- Making him too socially skilled too fast - keep some awkwardness
- Forgetting his physical vulnerability - he's still not a combatant
- Losing his sardonic voice as he grows emotionally
- Making connections too deep too fast - selective and bounded
- Forgetting he changes appearance when stressed

### Revision Planning

**Arc 2-3 Needs:**
- Foreshadow his limitations about information warfare
- Plant seeds of potential for growth beneath detachment
- Show costs of isolation even as he maintains it

**Arc 4 Needs:**
- Make confrontation with Kyr4n sharp and humbling but not destroying
- Show Helene conflict clearly to establish stakes
- Demonstrate his blind spots about emotional context
- Leave him wounded but not broken - room to grow

**Arc 5-6 Needs:**
- Show realistic pace of emotional learning - gradual
- Demonstrate selective trust rather than wholesale change
- Maintain core independence while building connections
- End with sustainable balance, not dramatic transformation
