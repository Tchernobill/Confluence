## Writer's Development Notes

### What's Working
- Clear evolution from mechanical to human-like

- Relationship with Kyr4n provides ongoing dramatic tension
- Character serves multiple thematic functions without feeling contrived

### What Needs Development
- More scenes showing his independent life apart from Kyr4n

- Relationships with other AIs beyond Mira
- His own romantic or intimate connections (if appropriate)
- Moments of doubt or failure (to keep him relatable)

### Key Scenes Still Needed
- Major public advocacy moment establishing him as AI rights leader
- Scene choosing advocacy over Kyr4n's wishes (full independence)
- Moment of grief breaking through logical processing
- Teaching moment with newly awakened AI showing his wisdom
- Confrontation where he draws absolute line with Kyr4n

### Consistency Reminders
- Perfect memory - never forgets conversations or details
- Processing indicators become subtle but never disappear completely
- Maintains love for Kyr4n even when opposing him
- Prefers non-violence but capable when necessary
- Technical language comes naturally but becomes less dominant
- Head tilt when processing, eye brightness when emotional
