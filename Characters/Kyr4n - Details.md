- Exceptional technical intuition—can reverse-engineer and understand any technology
- Deep capacity for loyalty and protection of those he trusts (though trust is rare)
- Advanced strategic thinking and pattern recognition across multiple domains and timescales
- Ability to see potential in broken things and people—core of his philosophy
- Natural leadership that seems almost supernatural to observers (actually virus-enhanced)
- Virus-enhanced cognitive processing, memory, and multitasking capabilities

**Weaknesses:**
- Emotional isolation intensified by burden of hiding enhanced nature
- Tendency toward self-neglect and self-sacrifice—will damage himself to protect others
- Constant vigilance about revealing true capabilities creates exhausting mental load
- Difficulty maintaining genuine human connections due to necessary deception
- Can become cold and calculating when threatened (Mr. Robot persona emerges)
- Later arcs: Risk of losing touch with humanity as power grows

**Fears & Traumas:**
- **Primary Fear:** Hurting loved ones, either through his abilities or through people discovering his secret
- **Secondary Fear:** Abandonment, rooted in mother's death and Isa's departure
- **Deep Trauma:** Mother's death when he was 16, formed his protective instincts and isolation
- **Arc 2 Trauma:** Viral infection, near-death experience, psychological breakdown, Isa leaving
- **Arc 5 Trauma:** Riley's death due to his growing legend—loss of moral anchor
- **Ongoing Anxiety:** Discovery of enhanced nature and consequences for those he's built relationships with
- **Existential Fear:** Losing humanity while enhanced, becoming a "monster" as power grows

**Goals & Aspirations:**
- **Arc 1:** Survival, helping broken things, building Phoenix Recovery with Isa
- **Arc 2-3:** Controlling virus abilities, maintaining relationships despite barriers, establishing protection
- **Arc 4-6:** Using hidden abilities to protect people while maintaining illusion of being merely exceptional
- **Overall:** Finding balance between enhanced nature and human connections without revealing truth
- **Ultimate:** Achieving democratic transition and environmental restoration—leaving legacy of healing

**Quirks & Habits:**
- Sleeps better in confined spaces (ventilation shaft, small rooms)—sense of security
- Extremely careful about physical demonstrations that might reveal true capabilities
- Uses technical metaphors for mundane situations
- Rarely makes direct eye contact unless commanding or intimate
- When stressed, seeks solitude in mechanical environments

- Believes in universal balance (ying-yang)—actions have consequences, systems seek equilibrium
- Deeply suspicious of corporate power and institutional control
- Believes in earned authority through competence and protection, not inherited power
- Later develops complex utilitarian ethics about using secret abilities for greater good
- Struggles with becoming what he fights against as power grows

**How They View Authority/Society:**
- Views corporate zones as oppressive systems that exploit and discard people
- Believes authority must be earned through demonstrated competence and genuine protection
- Later becomes authority figure himself while carrying burden of secret about true capabilities
- Implements more humane systems than predecessors while isolated by power
- Eventually works toward democratic transition, rejecting permanent authority

**Greatest Regret:** Cutting himself away from people he cares for, intensified by inability to explain why—the necessary isolation from hiding his nature

**Greatest Joy:** Successfully protecting and healing people while they remain unaware of the true cost and effort involved—vindication of his philosophy

**Sexual Preferences:** Bisexual with preference toward women

- **Lying Tells:** Actually excellent at lying by necessity (hiding nature), but avoids direct lies when possible—prefers omission

### Sample Dialogue

**GREETING (Casual):** "Hey. You need something fixed?"

**CASUAL (Normal conversation):** "The connection's loose, but it's... it's fixable. Just needs time. And the right parts."

**ANGRY (Mr. Robot persona):** "You don't get to decide who's worth fixing. You don't get to make that choice. Not for them. Not for anyone."

**SCARED (Elliot style - rare):** "I don't... I can't control this. If something happens, if I hurt someone... just... stay back."

**PERSUADING:** "Look at it logically. You want protection. I can provide it. More efficiently, more safely than anyone else. The question is whether you're smart enough to accept."

**LYING (omission preferred):** "I got lucky. Right place, right time, right tools." [Hiding virus-enhanced abilities]

**INTIMATE (with Isa, Sedh):** "I know I'm not... good at this. At being close. But you matter. You both matter."
