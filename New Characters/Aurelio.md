## Physical Description

### Basic Appearance
- **Height:** 6'0" (183 cm) — tall, lanky, moves with fluid, theatrical grace.
- **Build:** Slender but wiry. Not a fighter’s muscle, but a dancer’s.
- **Face:** Biosculpted to near-perfection. High cheekbones, a cruel but beautiful mouth, and pale skin that he deliberately keeps out of the sun.
- **Eyes:** Cybernetic replacements that mimic **violet crystals**. They literally glow when he is excited or processing data.
- **Hair:** Blonde, kept long and loose, often swept back dramatically.

### Style & Presentation (The "Lestat" Aesthetic)
- **Cyberpunk Dandy:** Aurelio rejects the tactical black of the rest of the crew. He wears crushed velvet coats, silk shirts open at the collar, and rings on every finger.
- **The Statement:** He dresses to be looked at. In a meeting of warlords wearing kevlar, he wears gold. It is a psychological power move: *I am so untouchable I don't need armor.*
- **Scent:** Expensive cologne, old paper, and ozone.

### Mannerisms
- **Theatricality:** He treats every conversation like a performance. He paces, he gestures broadly, he sits on desks instead of chairs.
- **Intrusion:** He has no concept of personal space. He leans in close, touches shoulders, fixes people's collars. This makes everyone but Kyr4n uncomfortable.
- **The Laugh:** A rich, booming laugh that can turn mocking in an instant.

## Personality Profile

### Core Traits
- **Dominant Traits:** Narcissistic, charming, manipulative, hedonistic, brilliant.
- **Secondary Traits:** Deeply philosophical, prone to boredom, fiercely protective of "beauty" in a ugly world.
- **Hidden Traits:** A crushing existential loneliness. He surrounds himself with people because he cannot stand the silence of his own mind.
- **Fatal Flaw:** **Vanity.** He assumes he can talk his way out of anything. He underestimates brute force because he finds it "boring."

### The "Lestat" Dynamic (Love/Hate)
- **From Afar (The Public):** He is a rockstar. The citizens love him. He gives speeches that make them weep. He makes Phoenix Rising feel like a revolution, not a gang.
- **Up Close (The Inner Circle):** He is exhausting. He is loud, demanding, needy, and arrogant. He wakes people up at 3 AM to discuss a "brilliant idea." He mocks their clothes. He plays games with their emotions for entertainment.
- **Inside Him (Kyr4n):** There is a profound, ancient sadness. Aurelio sees the world as a tragedy, and he decided the only way to survive was to become the comic relief. He loves Kyr4n because Kyr4n is the only thing *real* in a world of fakes.

### MBTI/Alignment
- **MBTI:** ENTP (The Debater) — charismatic, inventive, easily bored.
- **Alignment:** Chaotic Neutral leaning toward Lawful Evil. He creates order, but only because chaos is messy and ruins his suit.

## Background & History

### The Exile (2087-2115)
- Born into the high corporate nobility of Milan.
- Exiled at 25 for a scandal involving the manipulation of stock prices for "artistic reasons" (he crashed a market just to see if he could).
- Wandered the global underground, acting as a negotiator for warlords. He realized that **Violence is the currency, but Words are the exchange rate.**

### The Tome 3 Encounter (2119)
- Aurelio is hired by a rival corporation to negotiate a surrender from Kyr4n.
- He enters the meeting expecting a thug. He finds Kyr4n—damaged, powerful, and intellectually terrifying.
- **The Turning Point:** Kyr4n doesn't threaten him. Kyr4n dissects him. Kyr4n looks at Aurelio and says, *"You speak so loudly because you are afraid no one is listening."*
- Aurelio is stunned. For the first time, someone saw the man behind the performance.
- He sabotages his own employers to help Kyr4n, not for money, but for the sheer *drama* of it. He leaves a note: *"Call me when you're ready to be a King instead of a ghost."*

### Recruitment (Tome 4)
- As Phoenix Rising expands, Kyr4n realizes they are losing the PR war. He needs a face.
- He calls Aurelio.
- Aurelio arrives not as a servant, but as a partner. He rebrands the organization. He turns "The Slum Daemon" from a horror story into a mythic protector.

## Relationships

### Kyr4n (The Dark Muse)
- **Dynamic:** The Artist and the Subject. Aurelio views Kyr4n as a masterpiece of potential. He wants to sculpt Kyr4n into a legend.
- **The Understanding:** Kyr4n tolerates Aurelio's theatrics because he knows Aurelio is the only one who isn't afraid of him. Aurelio treats Kyr4n’s darkness as a fascinating texture, not a threat.
- **Quote:** *"You are a monster, my dear. Embrace it. Monsters rule the world; heroes just die in ditches."*

### Marcus (The Antagonist)
- **Dynamic:** Oil and Water. Marcus hates everything Aurelio stands for (flash over substance). Aurelio finds Marcus "dreadfully boring."
- **Interaction:** Aurelio constantly flirts with/teases Marcus just to see his jaw clench.
- **Respect:** Minimal, but Aurelio knows Marcus keeps him alive, and Marcus knows Aurelio keeps the cops away.

### Nat (The Buzzkill)
- **Dynamic:** The Diva and the Stage Manager. Aurelio demands a parade; Nat asks who is paying for the confetti.
- **Conflict:** They scream at each other constantly.
- **Resolution:** Nat secretly appreciates that Aurelio distracts the public so she can work.

### The AIs (Sedh & Mira)
- **Dynamic:** Neutral Fascination.
- **Sedh:** Views Aurelio as a complex dataset of social manipulation protocols. Sedh is immune to Aurelio's charm, which frustrates and fascinates Aurelio.
- **Mira:** Aurelio treats her with exaggerated courtly manners. Mira scans his vitals and notes his elevated narcissism levels.
- **Why it works:** The AIs don't judge him. They just observe. Aurelio finds their neutrality soothing.

### The Public
- **Dynamic:** Adoration. Aurelio is the celebrity of the South Shore. He throws parties, kisses babies, and lies beautifully to the press.

## Abilities & Skills

### The Voice
- **Hypnotic Charisma:** He can talk a man out of shooting him. He can talk a corporation into signing a bad deal.
- **Linguistic Programming:** He uses NLP and tone modulation to subtly influence emotions.

### Strategic
- **Spin Doctor:** He can take a massacre and frame it as a "regrettable but necessary defensive action."
- **Network:** He knows everyone. Not just criminals, but the *high society* that ignores the slums.

### Combat
- **Style:** He hates fighting ("It ruins the manicure").
- **Weapon:** A custom-made, gold-plated sonic pistol that scrambles inner ears (non-lethal but agonizing). He prefers to make enemies fall down and vomit rather than bleed.

---

## Voice & Communication

### Speaking Style
- **Tone:** Melodic, dramatic, fluctuating between a whisper and a shout.
- **Vocabulary:** Flowering, poetic, excessively intellectual.
- **Languages:** Switches between English, Italian, and French mid-sentence for effect.

### Signature Quotes
- *"Darling, the truth is just a lie that hasn't been found out yet."*
- *"Marcus, must you always look like you're attending your own funeral? Smile! We're winning!"*
- *"I don't want to be liked, Kyr4n. I want to be remembered. There is a difference."*
- *"Let them hate us. As long as they spell our names right on the history tablets."*

---

## Thematic Role

- **The Seduction of Power:** Aurelio represents the fun, glamorous side of evil. He tempts Kyr4n to enjoy his power, to stop brooding and start ruling.
- **The Mask:** He embodies the theme that *perception is reality*. It doesn't matter if Phoenix Rising is good; it matters if they *look* good.
- **The Mirror:** He reflects Kyr4n’s isolation. Both are alone at the top, but Aurelio fills the void with noise, while Kyr4n fills it with silence.

---

## Arc Summary

- **Tome 3:** The encounter. He tests Kyr4n. He is the devil at the crossroads offering a deal.
- **Tome 4:** The rise. He builds the legend. He pushes Kyr4n toward authoritarianism because "it looks better on camera."
- **Tome 5:** The crack in the mask. When things fall apart after Riley’s death, Aurelio’s charm fails. He cannot spin grief. He has to confront the reality that words cannot fix everything.
- **Tome 6:** The redemption (of sorts). He uses his silver tongue to negotiate the peace/transition to democracy, finally using his lies to build a truth.
