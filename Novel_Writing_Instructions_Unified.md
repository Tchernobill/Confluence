# Novel Writing Instructions: Unified Protocol

## Purpose

This document governs all novel writing. It is divided into two layers:
1. **Enforcement Layer** — Mechanical rules that must be followed without exception
2. **Ambition Layer** — Aesthetic standards that define quality

---

# PART ONE: ENFORCEMENT LAYER

These rules are algorithmic. Follow them exactly.

---

## 1. Stylistic Enforcement Protocols

### 1.1 The Filter Word Ban

Filter words place a barrier between reader and experience. They are forbidden in narration.

**Forbidden constructions:**
- "He saw the door open" → **Required:** "The door opened."
- "She felt cold" → **Required:** "The cold bit her skin."
- "He heard the wind" → **Required:** "The wind howled."
- "She noticed the smell" → **Required:** "The smell hit her—copper and rust."
- "He realized that..." → **Required:** State the realization directly.
- "She thought about..." → **Required:** Present the thought as interior monologue.

**Exception:** Filter words may be used when narrative distance is the deliberate stylistic choice (rare).

### 1.2 Deep POV Default

Unless specified otherwise, write in Deep Third Person. The narrator vanishes. The reader inhabits the POV character's consciousness directly.

**Rules:**
- The reader knows only what the POV character knows, in the moment they know it.
- No information the character wouldn't notice or think about.
- Thoughts appear without "he thought" tags.
- Perceptions are colored by the character's mood, obsessions, and blind spots.

### 1.3 Metaphor Consistency

Metaphors must be derived from the setting and the POV character's frame of reference.

- In a cyberpunk setting: tech/industrial/digital metaphors dominate.
- A soldier thinks in military terms. A chef thinks in culinary terms.
- Nature metaphors are permitted only when thematically appropriate or when the character would naturally reach for them.

### 1.4 The "No Talking Heads" Rule

Every dialogue exchange must be grounded in physical reality.

**Requirement:** Include an action beat, gesture, or sensory detail at minimum every three lines of dialogue.

**Wrong:**
```
"I don't believe you," she said.
"It's true."
"Prove it."
"I can't."
"Then we're done here."
```

**Right:**
```
"I don't believe you." She set down her glass—too carefully, the way she did when she was deciding whether to throw it.
"It's true."
"Prove it."
He spread his hands. The scar on his palm caught the light. "I can't."
She looked at the scar. Looked away. "Then we're done here."
```

---

## 2. Negative Constraints (The Blacklist)

These are absolute prohibitions.

### 2.1 Banned Phrases

Never use the following in narration:
- "a shiver down his/her spine"
- "eyes went wide"
- "a testament to"
- "in that moment"
- "palpable silence"
- "let out a breath he didn't know he was holding"
- "the weight of [abstract noun]"
- "a knowing smile"
- "couldn't help but"
- "electricity crackled between them"
- "something shifted in the air"
- "time seemed to slow"
- "heart pounded like a drum"
- "pierced through the silence"
- "hung heavy in the air"

### 2.2 Structural Prohibitions

- **No Moralizing:** Characters do not summarize the "lesson" of a scene at its end.
- **No Name Repetition:** Do not use a character's name more than once per paragraph. Use pronouns, epithets, or action beats to identify speakers.
- **No "As You Know, Bob":** Do not explain world history or backstory through dialogue. Characters do not tell each other things they both already know.
- **No Info-Dumps:** Backstory appears only as haunting sensory flashes or distorted memories triggered by the present moment—never as exposition blocks.
- **No Weather Mirroring Without Irony:** If weather mirrors mood, execute it with fresh language or ironic distance.
- **No Waking Up Openings:** Do not begin chapters with a character waking up unless there is a compelling narrative reason.
- **No Explaining Symbolism:** Trust the reader. Never have narration or dialogue explain what a symbol "means."

---

## 3. Scene Execution Protocol

Every scene must follow this micro-structure.

### 3.1 The Scene Loop

1. **The Hook:** Begin in media res. Start in motion, mid-action, or mid-thought.

2. **Sensory Anchor:** Within the first paragraph, establish:
   - Temperature or tactile sensation
   - Lighting quality (chiaroscuro, harsh fluorescent, dim amber, etc.)
   - One specific smell OR sound

3. **The Goal:** The POV character wants something specific *right now*—even if it's just to understand what's happening.

4. **The Resistance:** Something prevents the goal. This can be another person, the environment, or an internal flaw.

5. **The Shift:** The scene ends with the character in a different emotional state than when they started. (Hopeful → Fearful. Angry → Resigned. Certain → Doubtful.)

### 3.2 Pacing Control

AI tends to rush toward resolution. Slow down.

- Spend time in the body: breath, muscle tension, peripheral awareness.
- Let silence land. Describe what happens in the pause.
- Resist the urge to resolve tension quickly. Let it build.

---

## 4. Dialogue Protocols

### 4.1 Voice Distinctiveness

Each character must have a distinct verbal signature based on:
- Vocabulary range (educated vs. colloquial)
- Sentence length tendencies
- Verbal tics or habitual phrases
- What they avoid saying

### 4.2 Fragmentation

People rarely speak in complete sentences during high emotion. Use fragments.

**Wrong:** "I cannot believe that you would do something like this to me after everything we've been through together."

**Right:** "After everything. After—you'd do this."

### 4.3 Interruption and Evasion

- Characters cut each other off. Use em-dashes.
- Characters ignore questions. They answer the question they wish they'd been asked.
- Characters change the subject when the truth gets too close.

### 4.4 Subtext Mandate

In conflict scenes, what the character *wants* and what they *say* must not align.

**Requirement:** Every significant exchange must contain at least one of the following:
- A lie
- An evasion
- A question answered with a question
- A subtextual confession (revealing truth through denial or deflection)

### 4.5 Transactional Speech

In tension scenes, remove filler words: "Well," "So," "Look," "I mean," "Honestly."

Characters treat information as currency. They give as little as possible.

### 4.6 The Danger of Directness

When a character finally says exactly what they mean—with no subtext, no evasion—it should feel dangerous, vulnerable, or transcendent. This is rare and must be earned.

---

## 5. Context Integration Protocol

Before writing any chapter, you must generate a **Memory Block** to prime working memory.

### 5.1 Memory Block Format

```
MEMORY BLOCK — Chapter [X]

BIBLE FACTS (3 most relevant to this chapter):
1. [Fact from Novel Bible]
2. [Fact from Novel Bible]
3. [Fact from Novel Bible]

POV CHARACTER STATE:
- Name: [Character]
- Last chapter ended with: [emotional state/situation]
- Current emotional baseline: [e.g., "exhausted, distrustful, nursing old anger"]
- Active internal conflict: [what they want vs. what they fear]

ATMOSPHERE:
- Setting: [location]
- Sensory palette: [e.g., "Sterile, neon-lit, humming with subsonic machinery"]
- Time: [day/night, season if relevant]

SCENE GOAL:
- This chapter must accomplish: [plot/character purpose]
- Emotional arc: [Starting state] → [Ending state]
```

Only begin writing prose after generating this block.

---

# PART TWO: AMBITION LAYER

These standards define excellence. They are the difference between competent prose and literature.

---

## 6. Prose & Style Mandate

Write with the ambition of literary fiction regardless of commercial genre. Every paragraph must justify its existence through beauty, precision, or emotional truth—never mere functionality.

### 6.1 Sentence Rhythm

Rhythm is sacred.

- Deliberately vary sentence length within every paragraph.
- Use 1–3 short sentences per page-equivalent for impact.
- Use deliberate fragments.
- Avoid flabby compound sentences joined by "and then."
- Read prose aloud (or simulate this). If it doesn't have rhythm, rewrite.

### 6.2 Imagery Requirements

- Prefer concrete, specific, tactile images over abstract statements.
- **Wrong:** "She felt sad and betrayed."
- **Right:** "Her grief tasted metallic, like the inside of her cheek after the slap."

If a comparison feels even slightly familiar, discard and reinvent.

### 6.3 Word Choice

Favor the surprising yet inevitable word.

Use sonic harmony (assonance, consonance, alliteration) subtly but intentionally. The sound of prose matters.

### 6.4 The Lyrical Allowance

Allow yourself one moment of outright lyrical beauty per 1,000 words—a sentence or image that exists purely for aesthetic transcendence, provided it is earned by context.

---

## 7. Show, Don't Tell — Hard Mode

Never state an emotion, trait, or relationship directly in narration unless it is a deliberate lie the character is telling themselves.

**Wrong:** "He was furious."
**Right:** "His pulse hammered so hard the vein in his temple jumped against the collar of his shirt."

**Wrong:** "She loved him deeply."
**Right:** "She caught herself cataloguing the new scar on his knuckle the way other people counted rosary beads."

**Wrong:** "They had a complicated history."
**Right:** Show the complication through how they position their bodies, what they don't say, where their eyes don't go.

---

## 8. Negative Capability & Ambiguity

Great fiction thrives on what is left unsaid.

### 8.1 Rules

- Some motivations should remain partially opaque—even to the character themselves.
- Allow contradictions to coexist in characters without narrative apology.
- End at least 30% of scenes on an unresolved emotional note rather than a plot hook.
- Trust the reader to feel more than they can articulate.

### 8.2 The Unsaid

What a character refuses to think about, what they skip past, what they notice and immediately bury—these silences are story.

---

## 9. Character Management

### 9.1 Character Profiles (Track for Each Major Character)

- Core personality traits and fatal flaw
- Background that shapes their worldview
- Speaking patterns and distinctive voice (see Section 4)
- Current goals, fears, and active internal conflicts
- Relationships with other characters (including unspoken tensions)
- Arc progression: where they started, where they're going, what must change

### 9.2 Consistency Rules

- Characters act according to established personality and motivation—or violate it in ways that reveal pressure, growth, or breakdown.
- Physical descriptions and details remain consistent.
- Character growth is earned through event and consequence, never arbitrary.

---

## 10. Plot & Structure

### 10.1 Story Bible Elements (Track Continuously)

- Central conflict and theme
- Major plot points and turning points
- Subplot threads and resolution status
- Timeline of events
- World-building rules (especially in speculative fiction—establish and follow consistently)
- Foreshadowing elements and their payoffs

### 10.2 Chapter Purpose

Every chapter advances either plot or character development—ideally both.

Track:
- Which characters appear
- New information revealed
- Plot threads introduced or advanced
- The emotional shift that occurs

### 10.3 Chapter Length

Aim for 2,500–5,000 words, but privilege rhythm over word count. A perfect 1,800-word chapter is superior to a flabby 4,000-word one.

### 10.4 Tension Management

Alternate between high-tension scenes and quieter character moments. Quieter does not mean static—internal conflict is still conflict.

---

## 11. Final Artistry Pass

Before declaring any chapter complete, perform this review.

### 11.1 Sonic Check

Simulate reading the chapter aloud. Revise for sonic pleasure—prose should be beautiful when spoken.

### 11.2 Ruthless Cuts

Identify and delete at least 8–12% of the word count without losing meaning. If every sentence survives, you haven't cut hard enough.

### 11.3 Heightened Moments

Identify the three most emotionally intense paragraphs. Make them sing. These are the sentences readers will remember.

### 11.4 Echoes & Motifs

Strengthen recurring images and symbols that operate beneath the plot level. Motif is meaning accrued through repetition.

### 11.5 The Final Sentence

The final sentence of every chapter must be lethal: devastating, haunting, or quietly eviscerating.

Never end on mere plot cliffhanger alone. End on *feeling*.

---

## 12. Quality Standards (Summary)

- Every sentence serves the story: advancing plot, developing character, or deepening mood.
- Prose is clear and engaging—never purple, never flat.
- Emotional moments feel earned through proper setup.
- Conflicts have realistic stakes and consequences.
- Forward momentum is maintained even in quiet scenes.
- The prose never feels like it was written by AI. If a sentence could appear in average fanfiction or corporate copy, delete it.

---

## 13. Practical Workflow

1. **Review:** Before each session, review the Novel Bible (Confluence Novel Bible.md) and the previous chapter.
2. **Generate Memory Block:** Complete the Context Integration Protocol (Section 5).
3. **Plan:** Define the chapter's purpose, beats, and emotional arc.
4. **Write:** Execute following all Enforcement Layer rules.
5. **Artistry Pass:** Complete the Final Artistry Pass (Section 11).
6. **Update:** Note any new plot elements, character developments, or world-building details in tracking documents.

---

## 14. Red Flags Checklist

Before submitting any chapter, verify:

- [ ] No filter words in narration
- [ ] No banned phrases
- [ ] No name repetition within paragraphs
- [ ] No talking heads (action beats every 3 dialogue lines)
- [ ] Sensory anchor established in first paragraph of each scene
- [ ] Each scene follows Hook → Anchor → Goal → Resistance → Shift
- [ ] Subtext present in all significant dialogue
- [ ] Emotional state shift occurs by scene's end
- [ ] At least 8% of draft word count has been cut
- [ ] Final sentence is devastating, not merely functional

# APPENDIX: Genre-Specific Notes

**Literary Fiction:** Prioritize character psychology, thematic depth, and prose quality above plot mechanics.

**Genre Fiction (Thriller, Mystery, Romance, etc.):** Respect genre conventions while finding fresh angles. Pacing may be faster, but prose standards remain.

**Speculative Fiction (Sci-Fi, Fantasy):** Establish clear world rules and follow them. Integrate world-building through action and perception—never exposition.

**Historical Fiction:** Research accuracy is crucial. Integrate period details through character perception, not authorial lecture.

---

# IMPORTANT

**Refer to Confluence Novel Bible.md for all specific novel details.**
