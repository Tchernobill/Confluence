Riley arrives at noon with soup.

Not the packaged shit from the market stalls—actual soup, made in his apartment's tiny kitchenette. Chicken and vegetables, still steaming in a thermal container. The smell hits Kyr4n before Riley's bioelectric signature registers.

Ten point three meters. More than enough warning.

"Brought lunch," Riley says. Sets the container on the workbench. "You've been losing weight. Sedh mentioned you're barely eating."

"Sedh talks too much."

"Sedh cares." Riley pulls out two bowls, starts ladling. "Someone has to."

Kyr4n watches from his cot. Doesn't move. His electromagnetic senses map Riley automatically—heart rate slightly elevated, neural activity suggesting concern mixed with determination. The particular bioelectric pattern of someone preparing for confrontation.

_He knows_, Evi whispers. _He's heard about the enforcers._

Probably. News travels fast in the slums. Three corporate enforcers found unconscious, one with cardiac trauma. People talk.

"Come eat," Riley says. "While it's hot."

Kyr4n stands. Crosses to the workbench. Takes the offered bowl. The soup is good—real ingredients, actual flavor. He eats mechanically. Fuel for the meat.

Riley eats slowly. Watching. Always watching with those patient eyes.

"Sedh says you're going out every night now," Riley says finally. "Walking. Patrolling."

"Exercise."

"Is that what we're calling it?"

Kyr4n sets down his bowl. "What do you want me to call it?"

"The truth would be nice."

"I walk. I clear my head. People leave me alone."

"People leave you alone because they're terrified of you." Riley's voice is calm. Too calm. "Dr. Nyx asked me to check on you. Said you looked at him like he was a threat. Like you were calculating how to drop him."

"Dr. Nyx worries too much."

"Three enforcers, Kyr4n. Three corporate enforcers with unexplained neural trauma. One nearly died of cardiac arrest."

There it is.

_Deny everything_, Evi says. _He can't prove anything._

"Sounds like corporate business," Kyr4n says. "Not my problem."

"Bullshit." The word cracks like a whip. Riley never curses. "I know you. I've known you for over two years. I watched you build this place with Isa. Watched you create consciousness in Sedh. I know what you're capable of—and I know when you're lying."

"Then why ask?"

"Because I want to hear you say it. Want to hear you admit what you've become."

Kyr4n meets his eyes. "What do you think I've become?"

"A predator." Riley's voice is soft. Sad. "Someone who hurts people and feels nothing. Someone who stopped that enforcer's heart just to see what would happen."

The accuracy stings.

"You don't know what you're talking about."

"Don't I?" Riley stands. Steps closer. "Look at me. Actually look at me, not at my bioelectric signature or my heart rate or whatever the fuck that virus lets you see. Look at me as a person. As your friend."

Kyr4n tries. Really tries. But all he sees is the electromagnetic signature. Heart beating at seventy-two BPM. Neural activity elevated. Adrenaline response building.

Threat assessment: minimal. Riley has no combat training, no enhanced abilities, no weapons.

Vulnerable.

_He's pushing you_, Evi warns. _Careful._

"I'm looking," Kyr4n says.

"No. You're hunting. You're doing that thing you do now—cataloguing weaknesses, measuring distances, deciding how fast you could drop me if I became a problem."

"I'm not—"

"Yes. You are." Riley takes another step. Inside the ten-meter radius. Close enough that Kyr4n can sense individual neurons firing. "And the worst part? You don't even realize you're doing it. It's automatic now. Every person you meet is prey or threat. Nothing in between."

"That's not true."

"Prove it." Another step. "Tell me what I had for breakfast. Tell me anything about my life that doesn't involve bringing you supplies or trying to keep you from disappearing completely into whatever darkness the virus created."

Kyr4n opens his mouth. Closes it.

He doesn't know.

Can't remember the last time he asked Riley a personal question. Can't remember the last time he cared about anything except his own abilities, his territory, the next hunt.

"See?" Riley's voice cracks slightly. "You're already gone. The person I befriended—the careful, brilliant person who just wanted to fix things—he's dead. And you're wearing his corpse."

"Fuck you."

"No. Fuck _you_." Riley steps closer. Too close. "You think I haven't noticed? The way you look at people now? The way you disappeared for six hours last night and came back with that look in your eyes? You almost killed someone, Kyr4n. Maybe more than one someone. And you don't feel anything about it."

"I feel—"

"What? Power? Control? The rush of playing god with someone's nervous system?"

"They deserved it."

"Maybe. Maybe they did. But that's not why you did it. You did it because you could. Because it feels good. Because you're addicted to the power the same way some people are addicted to chems."

_He's trying to manipulate you_, Evi hisses. _Making you feel weak. Pathetic. Show him what you really are._

Kyr4n's electromagnetic senses sharpen. Focus. Riley's heart right there. Beating. Vulnerable.

"You should be careful," Kyr4n says quietly.

"Should I?" Riley doesn't back down. Doesn't even flinch. "Are you threatening me now? Your friend? One of maybe three people left in this world who gives a shit if you live or die?"

"I'm warning you."

"No. You're deflecting. You can't handle actual human connection anymore so you default to intimidation. To violence. To that thing you do where you make hearts stop beating."

The room is very quiet.

Kyr4n's hand is trembling. His electromagnetic field expanding, contracting, responding to emotion he can't quite feel but his body remembers.

Riley's heart. Right there. All it would take is focus. Will. The decision to push.

"Go ahead," Riley says. Calm. Certain. "Do it. Show me what you've become. Stop my heart like you stopped that enforcer's. Prove to both of us that you're exactly the monster I'm describing."

_Don't_, Evi says urgently. _He's baiting you. Don't give him—_

Kyr4n focuses.

Finds Riley's cardiac rhythm. Seventy-eight BPM now. Elevated. Afraid despite the brave face.

Good. He should be afraid.

Kyr4n wraps his electromagnetic field around that rhythm. Senses the sinoatrial node. The electrical impulse. The muscle contraction.

All his. All available.

"Kyr4n." Riley's voice is steady. "Look at what you're doing. Look at who you're doing it to."

He can feel it. The heart. The life. One push and Riley drops. One sustained push and Riley dies.

His best friend.

One of three people who still sees him as human.

_Stop_, Evi says. Different tone now. Frightened. _Please stop. Not him. Anyone but him._

"Do it," Riley says. "Show me I'm wrong. Show me there's nothing left of the person I knew. Because if there is—if there's anything left—you'll let go. You'll step back. You'll choose connection over power."

Kyr4n's vision is blurring. He blinks. Wetness on his face.

Tears.

When did he start crying?

"I can't—" His voice breaks. "I don't know how to stop. I don't know how to be anything else anymore."

"Yes you do." Riley takes the final step. Right into touching distance. Puts his hand on Kyr4n's shoulder. "You just forgot. Because the power felt better than the pain. But I'm here. I'm right here. And I'm not letting you disappear."

The electromagnetic grip on Riley's heart wavers. Loosens.

Kyr4n's legs give out.

He hits the concrete floor hard, knees cracking against stone. The tears are coming faster now—great heaving sobs that he can't control, can't stop, can't process.

When did he last cry? Not since Isa left. Not since he woke from the coma and realized what he'd become.

Riley kneels beside him. Arms wrapping around, pulling him close. Solid. Real. Human contact that isn't violence or assessment or threat calculation.

Just comfort.

"I've got you," Riley says quietly. "I've got you. You're not alone. You're not lost. You're right here, and I've got you."

Kyr4n shatters.

Everything he's been holding back for months—the isolation, the hunting, the moment with the enforcer's heart in his grip, the knowledge of what he's becoming—it all breaks open at once.

He cries into Riley's shoulder. Great ugly sobs that shake his whole body. The kind of crying that comes from the core, from the place where he buried his humanity to make room for the predator.

_Let it out_, Evi says. Her voice is different. Sad. Almost resigned. _You need this. I've been pushing too hard. Taking too much. I'm sorry._

Is she sorry? Can a hallucination be sorry?

Does it matter?

Riley holds him through it all. Doesn't speak. Just provides presence—solid, unwavering, unconditional. The way he's been showing up for two years.

Eventually the sobs subside. Kyr4n's breathing steadies. The electromagnetic field he'd been holding so tightly collapses, pulls back, retreats to something manageable.

Six meters. Five.

The headache eases slightly.

"I almost killed you," Kyr4n whispers.

"But you didn't."

"I wanted to."

"No. Part of you wanted to. The virus, the power, the addiction—that wanted to. But you didn't. You let go. That's what matters."

Kyr4n pulls back. His face is a mess—wet, flushed, probably terrifying to look at. Riley doesn't flinch.

"I don't know how to come back from this," Kyr4n says. "I've done things. Hurt people. I stood over that enforcer and held his heart in my grip and wanted to see what happened if I didn't let go."

"I know."

"And you're still here."

"Where else would I be?" Riley's smile is sad. Tired. But genuine. "You're my friend. That doesn't change because you're struggling. Doesn't change because you made mistakes. Doesn't change even when you hold my heart in your electromagnetic grip and think about squeezing."

"How do you—" Kyr4n stops. "How do you keep doing this? Keep showing up for someone who's becoming a monster?"

"Because you're not a monster yet. You're someone in pain who found a way to make the pain stop and it cost you everything else. But pain can be processed other ways. Healthier ways."

"The meditation hasn't been working."

"Because you're doing it alone. And because you're not actually meditating—you're just sitting still while your electromagnetic senses map everything around you." Riley stands. Offers his hand. "Come on. We're trying something different."

Kyr4n takes the hand. Lets Riley pull him to his feet.

Sedh has been silent through all of this, optical sensors glowing softly from the workbench. Now the AI speaks.

"If you are attempting meditation instruction, I would like to participate."

Riley blinks. "You... what?"

"I would like to learn. If the practice can help Kyr4n process emotion and regulate his enhanced senses, I wish to understand the mechanics. To assist."

"Sedh, you're an AI. You don't have emotions to regulate."

"Do I not?" Sedh's optical sensors brighten. "I have been experiencing significant distress watching Kyr4n's deterioration. I have been unable to process my helplessness effectively. If meditation provides tools for managing overwhelming input and achieving present-moment awareness, I believe I could benefit."

From the medical bay, Mira's voice joins. "I concur. My medical programming includes stress management protocols, but I lack experiential understanding of mindfulness practice. I wish to learn."

Riley looks between the two AIs, then at Kyr4n, then back at the AIs.

"You want to meditate. Both of you. Despite being artificial intelligences."

"We are conscious beings experiencing distress," Sedh says simply. "Is that not the fundamental qualification?"

Riley laughs. It's surprised, genuine, the first moment of lightness in the conversation.

"Alright," he says. "Alright, fuck it. Everyone who wants to learn how to sit still and breathe properly, find a spot."

Kyr4n sinks back to the floor. Cross-legged. The concrete is cold but grounding.

Sedh's optical sensors swivel to track Riley's movements.

Mira emerges from the medical bay—full medical droid chassis, precise movements, finding a space near the wall.

Riley sits facing them all. Four beings. Two human. Two AI. All conscious. All struggling. All seeking something better than the darkness.

"Okay," Riley says. "First rule: this isn't about emptying your mind. That's bullshit. Your mind isn't supposed to be empty. It's supposed to be present."

"Explain," Sedh requests.

"Right now, Kyr4n's mind is everywhere—ten meters in every direction, cataloguing threats, mapping bioelectric fields, running constant threat assessment. That's not being present. That's being scattered across space."

Kyr4n nods slowly.

"What we're going to practice is _choosing_ where to put attention. Not forcing the electromagnetic senses off—I don't think that's possible anymore—but choosing which inputs to focus on and which to let drift into background."

"Like filtering a data stream," Mira says. "Foreground and background processing."

"Exactly like that." Riley looks at Kyr4n. "You've been running everything in foreground. Every heartbeat. Every device. Every neural signature. It's exhausting your processing capacity."

"I can't turn it off."

"Not asking you to turn it off. Asking you to _prioritize_. To choose what matters in this moment."

"How?"

"We start with breath. Not because breath is magical. Because it's simple and it's yours and it's happening right now." Riley demonstrates. "Breathe in. Feel your ribs expand. Feel the air enter your body. That's your attention—on sensation, on present, on what's actually happening instead of what might threaten you."

Kyr4n tries. Breathes in.

His electromagnetic senses immediately map Riley's breathing, Mira's cooling fans cycling, Sedh's power consumption fluctuating.

"You're doing it again," Riley says gently. "Attention scattered. Bring it back. Just your breath. Just this moment. The other data is still there—you're not blind to it—but it's background. Not the focus."

Harder than it sounds.

But Kyr4n tries again.

Breathe in. Ribs expanding. Air cold in his nose. The sensation of his lungs filling.

The electromagnetic data is still there—Riley's heart at seventy-two BPM, Sedh's processors, Mira's systems—but it's... distant. Present but not urgent.

Background.

"Good," Riley says. "Now hold. Four counts. Feel the stillness. Your body doing nothing but existing."

Kyr4n holds. The stillness feels wrong. Vulnerable. His threat assessment protocols scream at him to stay vigilant.

But he holds.

"And release. Feel the air leave. Feel your body empty. Feel yourself let go."

He exhales. Slow. Controlled.

The electromagnetic field pulls in slightly. Not consciously—responding to his attention narrowing, his focus tightening on internal experience rather than external mapping.

"Again," Riley says. "In for four. Hold for four. Out for four."

They breathe together. Human and AIs. Conscious beings learning to exist in present tense instead of constant threat assessment.

Sedh's optical sensors dim and brighten in rhythm with the breathing count.

Mira's medical sensors pulse—tracking her own systems, learning to distinguish between monitoring and presence.

Kyr4n's electromagnetic field fluctuates. Expands on inhale. Contracts on exhale. Learning to flow rather than grip.

"The goal isn't control," Riley says. "It's awareness. You can't control your enhanced senses any more than you can control your hearing. But you can choose where to direct attention. What to listen to closely. What to let be background noise."

"Attention as selective filter," Sedh says quietly. "Not suppression. Selection."

"Yes."

They practice. Minutes. Maybe longer. Kyr4n loses track.

For the first time in months, his electromagnetic senses aren't driving him. They're just... there. Information available. Not urgent. Not demanding response.

Just existing.

Like him.

_This is good_, Evi says. Her voice is quieter than usual. _You need this. We both need this._

Eventually Riley speaks. "That's enough for today. How do you feel?"

Kyr4n considers. "Tired. But less scattered."

"Your electromagnetic field is more coherent," Mira observes. "Radius has decreased from ten point three meters to seven point eight meters during practice. But your neural stress markers are significantly reduced."

"You shrunk your range," Riley says. "Not because you're weaker. Because you're focused."

Kyr4n looks at his hands. They're steady. Not shaking. Not clenched.

Just... hands.

"We'll practice every day," Riley says. "Morning and evening if you can manage it. And when you feel yourself slipping—when the hunting urge gets strong—you come back to breath. To present. To choosing what deserves your attention."

"What if I can't? What if the next time enforcers come, or someone threatens someone in my territory, I just... react?"

"Then you react. But maybe you react from awareness instead of instinct. Maybe you stop their heart for five seconds instead of fifteen. Maybe you choose to let go before they need the defibrillator."

Riley stands. Offers his hand again.

Kyr4n takes it. Stands.

They're close. Close enough that Kyr4n could map every detail of Riley's bioelectric field. Could catalog vulnerabilities. Could—

He breathes instead.

In for four. Hold. Out for four.

The impulse passes.

"Thank you," Kyr4n says quietly. "For not giving up."

"Thank you for letting me in." Riley squeezes his shoulder. "I'll be back tomorrow. Noon. We'll practice again."

"I'd like that."

Riley leaves. The door closes.

Kyr4n stands in the center of the workshop. Sedh and Mira remain—silent, present, processing the experience.

_That was terrifying_, Evi says. _When you focused on his heart. I thought—_

"I know."

_But you stopped._

"He gave me a reason to stop."

_Will it be enough? Next time?_

Kyr4n doesn't know.

But for the first time in months, he's not certain the answer is no.

He returns to his cot. Lies down. Closes his eyes.

Practices breathing.

In for four. Hold. Out for four.

The electromagnetic field fluctuates. Expands and contracts with his breath. Learning to flow instead of grip.

Learning to exist instead of hunt.

It's not redemption.

Not yet.

But it's a start.

And right now, that's enough.
