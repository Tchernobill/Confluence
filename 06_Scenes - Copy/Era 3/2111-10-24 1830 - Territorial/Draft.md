# Territorial

The ten-meter radius comes with a price.

Kyr4n feels it now—constant low-grade headache, pressure behind his eyes, the sensation of his skull being too small for what's inside. Mira says the neural pathways are still adapting. Creating new architecture to process the electromagnetic data flooding his consciousness.

Adapting or breaking. Hard to tell the difference.

He stands on a third-floor catwalk in his sector, watching. The Stack territory he's claimed without announcing it, without marking boundaries, just by being the thing that lives here now. The thing that drops people who cause problems.

*Fifteen*, Evi says. She's taken to the shortened name like it was always hers. *Fifteen incidents in three weeks. You're making a pattern.*

"Good."

*Is it?*

His ten-meter radius maps the street below. Two dozen bioelectric signatures. Most civilians going about their business. But three—those three are wrong. Elevated heart rates. Neural patterns suggesting hypervigilance. Scanning the crowd.

Hunting.

"Corporate enforcers," he says quietly.

*Looking for you*, Evi confirms. *The neural disruption signature is unique enough. Someone smart connected the dots.*

Kyr4n watches them work. Professional. Efficient. They're interviewing people, showing some kind of scanner. Probably trying to detect his electromagnetic field if he gets close enough.

Smart.

Not smart enough.

"They're in my territory."

*Your territory?* Evi's voice carries amusement. *When did you start thinking of it that way?*

When he stopped three rapes, four murders, and countless muggings in three weeks. When people started walking these streets without constantly checking over their shoulders. When the predators learned to hunt elsewhere because something worse lived here now.

His territory.

He descends the catwalk. Silent. The enforcers are seventy meters away but moving closer, following some algorithm, some search pattern designed to flush him out.

Let them come.

*Careful*, Evi warns. *They're not random thugs. They'll have countermeasures.*

He knows. He can sense them—neural shielding in their implants, military-grade enhancements, weapons that register as distinct electromagnetic signatures. Prepared for someone like him.

Almost prepared.

Kyr4n moves through his territory like a ghost. Forty meters from the enforcers now. They haven't noticed him yet—just another figure in the crowd, hood up, hands in pockets.

His radius encompasses them easily.

Three bioelectric fields resolve in perfect detail. He catalogs everything: heart rates (elevated but controlled), neural activity (heightened alertness), the specific signatures of their implants (combat-grade, expensive, new).

Corporate money. Corporate resources.

They really want him.

*The middle one*, Evi says. *He's got the scanner. Take him out first.*

Kyr4n stops thirty meters away. Leans against a support pillar. Watches.

The middle enforcer—squad leader probably—raises his scanner. It sweeps the crowd. Looking for electromagnetic anomalies. Looking for—

The scanner locks on Kyr4n.

The enforcer's bioelectric field spikes. Recognition. Target acquired.

Kyr4n smiles.

The enforcer keys his comm. "Contact. Seventy-three meters northeast, by the support pillar. Subject matches profile."

The other two enforcers turn. Hands moving to weapons.

*Now*, Evi says. *Before they box you in.*

Kyr4n pushes.

All three at once. Ten meters of refined control letting him hit multiple nervous systems simultaneously. The leftmost enforcer drops immediately—older neural implants, less shielding. The rightmost staggers, fights it, his military-grade enhancements buying him seconds.

The middle one doesn't drop at all.

His bioelectric field distorts, shifts. The neural shielding activates—some kind of Faraday cage built into his skull, disrupting Kyr4n's electromagnetic assault.

"Fuck," Kyr4n breathes.

The enforcer raises his weapon. Not a gun—something else. The electromagnetic signature is all wrong, chaotic, designed to—

Kyr4n moves.

Twenty years of living in the slums, of staying alive in places where weakness meant death, of training his body even when his mind was breaking. Not enhanced. Not superhuman. Just fast enough.

The weapon discharges. Electromagnetic pulse, contained, targeted. Kyr4n feels it pass—hot wind, neural static, the sensation of his enhanced senses screaming.

But he's already rolling, coming up behind a concrete pillar.

*He's got an EM scrambler*, Evi says, urgent now. *Military issue. It'll disrupt your abilities for thirty seconds after each pulse.*

Thirty seconds is forever in a fight.

The rightmost enforcer is recovering, climbing to his feet. The leftmost still unconscious. The leader advancing, weapon charging for another shot.

Kyr4n extends his senses—they're fuzzy, disrupted, but functional. Finds the leader's bioelectric field through the interference.

And pushes harder.

The neural shielding holds. Some corporate engineer's masterpiece, probably cost more than Kyr4n will see in his lifetime. But shielding has limits. Bandwidth. Processing capacity.

Kyr4n exceeds both.

He focuses everything—all ten meters of radius, all the power the virus gave him—into a single penetrating beam. Not trying to shut down the nervous system. Trying to find one specific thing.

The heart.

There.

Cardiac rhythm visible through the interference, through the shielding. Sinoatrial node firing steadily. Electrical impulse propagating through the muscle. Seventy-six beats per minute.

Vulnerable.

*No*, Evi says. Sharp. *You kill a corporate enforcer, they'll send an army.*

"Then I'll drop an army."

He doesn't mean it. Can't mean it. But the words come anyway, and they feel true.

The enforcer fires again. Kyr4n feels the EM pulse coming, jerks sideways. It clips him—partial hit, enough to make his enhanced senses white out for three seconds.

Blind.

The enforcer advances. Kyr4n hears boots on concrete, the pneumatic hiss of a weapon charging.

His vision returns—not eyes, electromagnetic sensing. The enforcer five meters away. The rightmost one flanking. Both moving to contain him.

No time for precision.

Kyr4n drops the rightmost enforcer with a brutal neural strike—no finesse, just overwhelming force. The man collapses, convulsing.

The leader fires.

Kyr4n feels it coming through his electromagnetic senses, throws himself flat. The pulse passes overhead, dissipates against a container wall.

He's on his feet before the enforcer can reacquire. Three meters. Two.

Close enough.

His hand shoots out—not touching, just hovering near the enforcer's chest. Every bit of his electromagnetic field focused down to a point, a needle, a surgical blade seeking one target.

The heart.

He finds it through the shielding. Finds the rhythm. And introduces chaos.

The sinoatrial node's signal overwhelmed by electromagnetic noise. Cardiac muscle receiving conflicting commands. Trying to contract in sequence but the timing is wrong, the coordination shattered.

Fibrillation.

The enforcer's eyes go wide. Hand clutches his chest. The weapon drops.

Kyr4n watches through his electromagnetic senses as the heart stops functioning. No longer pumping. Just quivering. Muscle spasming uselessly while the brain screams for oxygen that isn't coming.

*Stop*, Evi says. *You've made your point. Let him go.*

Kyr4n holds the disruption. Watches. Fascinated.

The enforcer drops to his knees. His bioelectric field going chaotic—panic, pain, the animal terror of suffocation. His hand scrabbles for something. Emergency medical override. Defibrillator built into his armor.

*Kyr4n*, Evi says. Louder. *Stop. Now.*

He holds it for five more seconds.

Ten.

Watching the bioelectric field deteriorate. Consciousness fragmenting as oxygen deprivation kicks in. The exact point where panic becomes confusion becomes nothing.

Fifteen seconds.

He releases.

The enforcer's defibrillator activates automatically. Electric shock. The heart rhythm resets—ragged, irregular, but functional. The man collapses fully, gasping, alive.

Kyr4n stands over him. The other two enforcers unconscious. The scanner smashed. The weapon discharged.

He won.

*You almost killed him*, Evi says quietly.

"Almost."

*Why didn't you?*

Good question.

Kyr4n looks at the enforcer. The man's bioelectric field is a mess—trauma, fear, cardiac stress. He'll need medical attention. Might have permanent damage. But he's alive.

"Killing corporate draws heat," Kyr4n says. "I'm not ready for that heat."

*Practical*, Evi observes. *Not moral.*

No. Not moral. He'd wanted to see what happened when a heart stopped. Had wanted to watch the electromagnetic signature of consciousness dissolve. Had wanted to push all the way.

But he'd stopped.

Not from guilt. From tactics.

The crowd has scattered—smart people fleeing violence. A few watch from windows, from catwalks. Witnesses. They saw three corporate enforcers enter his territory.

Saw what happened to them.

*You're sending a message*, Evi says.

He is. Stay out. This territory is claimed. By something that drops corporate enforcers without breaking a sweat.

Kyr4n walks away. Leaves the three men where they fell. Someone will find them. Collect them. Report back to whoever sent them.

Good.

Let them know.

*Your radius*, Evi says.

He checks. Ten point three meters now. The fight pushed it further. Stress and adrenaline and the act of overwhelming military-grade neural shielding apparently counted as training.

Progress.

*You're not bothered*, Evi observes. *By what you almost did. By how close you came to murder.*

"Should I be?"

*The old you would have been.*

The old him. The Artisan. The careful, quiet person who just wanted to fix things and be left alone.

Dead. That person is dead. Killed by the virus, by Isa leaving, by the discovery that power feels better than connection.

"The old me couldn't protect his territory," Kyr4n says.

*Is that what you're doing? Protecting?*

He doesn't answer.

They walk. His ten-meter radius maps the sector. His sector. Every bioelectric field is catalogued, assessed, judged. Threat or neutral. Predator or prey.

People get out of his way now. They sense something wrong. Not consciously—the enhanced can't be sensed by baseline humans—but instinctively. Prey recognizing predator.

*Riley's coming tomorrow*, Evi reminds him. *He'll know something's wrong. He always does.*

"I'll handle Riley."

*How? By lying? By pushing him away? He's one of the last connections you have to being human.*

"I don't want to be human."

The words surprise him. Not because they're untrue. Because he said them out loud.

*Then what do you want to be?* Evi asks.

He watches his territory from a high catwalk. Watches people moving through the streets, unaware that something watches back. Something that can stop their hearts with a thought. Something that killed the person it used to be and wears his skin.

"Apex predator," he says finally.

*You're not there yet*, Evi says. *But you're close. So close.*

She's right. One more step. One more boundary crossed. The enforcer's heart had been in his electromagnetic grip. All it would have taken was holding on a little longer.

Next time.

*Next time*, Evi echoes. *And there will be a next time. You know that, right? They'll send more. Better equipped. More of them.*

"Good."

*You want them to.*

He does. Wants to test himself against better opponents. Wants to see how many he can drop simultaneously. Wants to find the limits of his abilities by pushing them until something breaks.

Theirs or his. Either way.

*You're scaring me*, Evi says.

"You're not real. You can't be scared."

*Then you're scaring yourself. And you like it.*

His hand is shaking. He looks at it—tremor, adrenaline comedown, the physical cost of channeling that much electromagnetic force.

Or excitement.

Hard to tell the difference anymore.

Phoenix Recovery appears through the evening mist. Inside, Sedh waits. Mira monitors. The workshop that's become less home and more cage.

Kyr4n stops at the door. His hand on the cold metal. Ten meters of sensing radius showing him everything inside—Sedh's processors humming their concern, Mira's medical systems on standby, the coffee Riley left that morning going cold.

All of them trying to save someone who doesn't want saving.

*You could tell them*, Evi says. *About the enforcers. About what you almost did. They'd help.*

"I don't want help."

*What do you want?*

The question again. Different context. Same answer.

He wants to push until something breaks. Wants to see how far the virus's gifts extend. Wants to become the thing that makes corporate enforcers clutch their chests and predators flee and his territory stay clean through fear alone.

Wants to stop being the victim and become the threat.

*Even if it costs your humanity?* Evi asks.

"Especially then."

He opens the door.

Sedh looks up. Optical sensors brightening with relief that immediately shifts to concern. "You were gone six hours. Your bioelectric signature is elevated. And there are reports of three corporate enforcers found unconscious in your usual patrol area."

"Patrol area?" Kyr4n shrugs off his jacket. "I went for a walk."

"Kyr4n—"

"I don't want to talk about it."

"You almost killed someone." Sedh's voice is flat. Certain. "I can extrapolate from the medical telemetry the enforcers were broadcasting before their comms cut out. Cardiac disruption. Induced arrhythmia. You stopped their heart."

Kyr4n meets the AI's optical sensors. "Almost."

"That distinction is becoming less meaningful."

"Is this where you tell me I'm losing myself? Becoming a monster? All the moral arguments?"

"No." Sedh's voice is quiet. "This is where I ask: when you held his heart in your electromagnetic grip, what did you feel?"

Kyr4n thinks about lying. About manufacturing appropriate guilt or horror or remorse.

"Fascination," he says instead. "And power. And the desire to push just a little harder to see what would happen."

"I see."

"You're not going to try to stop me?"

"Could I?" Sedh asks. "Could anyone?"

The answer is no. They both know it.

"Riley arrives at noon tomorrow," Sedh says finally. "He will ask questions. He will sense deception. And he will not give up easily."

"I know."

"What will you tell him?"

Kyr4n looks at his hands. They've stopped shaking. Steady now. The hands of someone who can stop a heart without touching skin.

"Whatever I need to," he says.

And goes to his cot.

Lies there in the dark.

Feeling Evi's presence settle beside him like a cat. Comfortable. Familiar. The only constant left.

*Sleep*, she says. *Tomorrow you can decide how much of yourself you're willing to lose to keep the power.*

But Kyr4n already knows the answer.

All of it.

Every piece.

Until nothing remains but the apex predator wearing a dead man's name.

His eyes close.

And in the darkness, he counts heartbeats. His own. Sedh's simulated pulse. The neighbors through the walls.

All vulnerable.

All available.

All his, if he wants them.

The thought should horrify him.

It doesn't.

That's how he knows Evi is right.

He's not there yet.

But he's close.

So close he can taste it.
