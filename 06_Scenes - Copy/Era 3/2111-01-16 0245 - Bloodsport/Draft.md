The workshop is too small. Too safe. Too fucking quiet.

Kyr4n feels it in his teeth—that itch, that crawl, the particular restlessness that's been building for three days. Since the last walk. Since Isa took him through The Stacks and something happened to that man in the alley and he'd felt _nothing_.

Should have felt something.

Didn't.

Wants to feel it again.

_You're pacing_, Isa says. Her bioelectric signature pulses at his shoulder, amused. _Like a caged animal._

He is pacing. Has been for an hour. Maybe longer. Sedh watches from the workbench, optical sensors tracking each circuit Kyr4n makes around the workshop. Four steps to the wall. Turn. Four steps back. The concrete is wearing a path.

"I need—" He stops. Doesn't know how to finish that sentence.

_Out_, Isa supplies. _You need out. It's after midnight. Good time for a walk._

"Where?"

_Somewhere interesting._ Her voice drops, conspiratorial. Intimate. _Somewhere we can see what you're really capable of._

His heart kicks. Just once. Hard enough to hurt.

He should say no. Should recognize this for what it is—escalation, the spiral tightening, the virus finding new ways to isolate him by making isolation intolerable. Should call Riley. Tell Sedh to lock the door.

"Okay," he says instead.

Sedh's optical sensors flare brighter. "Kyr4n. Your neural activity indicates—"

"I'm going for a walk."

"At 2:47 AM."

"Fresh air."

"You went for a walk three days ago. You returned exhibiting signs of dissociative fugue. I would advise—"

"I don't need advice." The words come out harder than intended. "I need to fucking _move_."

Silence. Then: "Understood. Please carry your comm device."

Kyr4n finds his jacket. Heavy canvas, reinforced. The PitBull MKIII is already in the inner pocket—he doesn't remember putting it there but it's there, weight familiar against his ribs. His fingers brush the grip. Comfort.

_Good_, Isa says. _Just in case._

Just in case what?

He doesn't ask.

The night air hits him like cold water. Shock of it. The mist has lifted, replaced by something worse—a freezing drizzle that isn't quite rain, particles too small to dodge, accumulating slowly until everything's wet. The kind of precipitation that gets inside your clothes, your lungs, your bones.

Kyr4n loves it.

The cold makes him real. Makes his body something more than just the meat his consciousness pilots around. He feels his skin. His breath plumes white. His hands curl into fists inside his pockets and the knuckles crack.

_East_, Isa says. _Toward the industrial sector. That's where it gets interesting._

He walks.

Not the dreamlike drift of three days ago. This is purposeful. Hunting stride. His electromagnetic senses open gradually, carefully, the five-meter bubble of awareness expanding to encompass the street. Devices bloom in his consciousness—security cameras, their fields distinct and pulsing. Power lines overhead, humming their 60Hz song. A few bioelectric signatures in the distance, muted behind walls.

The Phoenix Recovery neighborhood is quiet this time of night. Legitimate businesses shuttered. The kind of quiet that makes you aware of your own footsteps, your own breathing.

He likes that too.

_You're feeling it_, Isa observes. Not a question.

He is. That aliveness. That presence in his own skin. The electromagnetic senses that usually overwhelm him with noise feel sharp tonight. Precise. Weapon instead of wound.

They pass into the industrial sector. The architecture changes—less residential container stacks, more warehouse spaces. Sheet metal buildings. Loading docks. Chain-link fencing topped with razor wire that gleams dully in the sparse streetlights.

Fewer cameras here. The corporations don't waste surveillance on areas that don't generate profit. Just darkness and empty streets and the occasional figure moving quickly from one shadow to another.

_There_, Isa says.

Kyr4n stops. Extends his senses.

Three bioelectric signatures. Seventy meters ahead. Clustered together in an alley between two warehouses. One signature elevated—fear response, adrenaline. The other two calm. Professional.

_Mugging_, Isa says. _Or worse._

He should walk past. Not his business. Not his problem. The slums run on a strict code: see nothing, hear nothing, survive.

His feet carry him toward the alley.

_That's my boy._

He approaches quietly. The drizzle masks sound. His enhanced senses map the scene before his eyes can confirm: three people. Two standing. One on the ground. The standing figures are armed—the electromagnetic signature of implanted weapons distinct against their bioelectric fields. Military-grade. Expensive.

The person on the ground has no implants. Civilian. Prey.

Kyr4n reaches the alley mouth. Stops just outside the spill of light from a flickering fixture mounted on the warehouse wall.

"—don't have it," the civilian is saying. Male. Young. Terrified. "I told you, I don't—"

"Then you're no use to us." The speaker is older. Calm. The kind of calm that comes from having done this before. Many times.

Kyr4n steps into the light.

All three heads turn. The muggers see him and something passes between them—assessment, calculation. He's lean, unarmed as far as they can tell, alone. Weak.

They're wrong about that.

"Walk away," the calm one says. Not a threat. Advice. Professional courtesy. _You don't want this trouble._

Kyr4n doesn't walk away.

_What are you going to do?_ Isa asks. Excited. She's excited.

He doesn't know. Hadn't thought past approaching. His heart is hammering now—not fear, something else. Anticipation. The electromagnetic fields of the three people bloom in his consciousness, detailed and intimate. He can sense their heart rates. Their neural activity. The exact moment the calm one decides he's a problem.

"Last chance," the man says.

Kyr4n smiles. Doesn't mean to. It just happens.

The calm one's field changes—decision made. He moves. Fast. Professional. Knife appearing from somewhere, already in motion toward Kyr4n's ribs.

Time doesn't slow. That's movie bullshit. But Kyr4n's perception _sharpens_. The electromagnetic signature of the knife blade. The neural firing pattern in the man's motor cortex. The exact trajectory.

He doesn't think about dodging.

He _wants_ it.

The blade gets within half a meter—

—and the man screams.

Not the knife-wound scream of the civilian on the ground. Something worse. Neural disruption. Every pain receptor firing at once. The man drops, convulsing, knife clattering on wet concrete.

The second mugger stares. "The fuck—"

_Him too_, Isa says. _Do him too._

Kyr4n extends his awareness deliberately this time. Focuses on the second mugger's bioelectric field. Finds the neural pathways. And _pushes_.

Not physically. Electromagnetically. The DarkNight modifications giving him something new, something Sedh and Mira haven't catalogued yet because he hasn't told them about it.

The ability to disrupt other nervous systems.

The second mugger drops. Both attackers writhing on the ground, bodies arching, mouths open in silent howls.

Kyr4n stands over them. Watches. Waits for the guilt, the horror, the human response to causing suffering.

Nothing.

Just satisfaction. Clinical interest. And underneath—excitement.

_Beautiful_, Isa breathes. _You're beautiful like this._

He should stop. Should let them recover. They're neutralized. Threat eliminated. The civilian is scrambling away, forgotten, survival instinct overriding gratitude.

Kyr4n doesn't stop.

He steps closer to the calm one—still conscious, still aware, eyes rolled back, foam at the corners of his mouth. Kyr4n crouches. Extends his hand. Hovers it inches above the man's chest.

Pushes _harder_.

The man's bioelectric field goes chaotic. Synapses misfiring. Pain centers lighting up like Christmas. Kyr4n watches the electromagnetic signature, fascinated. He's never really looked before. Never paid attention to what happens when a nervous system overloads.

It's intricate. Complex. Almost beautiful in its catastrophic failure.

_Enough_, Isa says. Warning in her voice now. _Someone might come._

Right. Practical considerations.

He releases the pressure. Both men collapse fully, unconscious. Breathing but barely. He should check their vitals. Should feel something about the damage he's just done.

He feels hungry.

_Let's go_, Isa says. _Before they wake up._

Kyr4n stands. His hands are shaking—not fear, not guilt. Adrenaline. Energy. The first real thing he's felt since the workshop became his prison.

They walk. Faster now. His electromagnetic senses extended fully, mapping the industrial sector. Looking for more. Needing more.

_Easy_, Isa cautions. _Don't be reckless._

"You told me to do it."

_I told you to defend yourself. That was defense. What you're looking for now—that's something else._

Is it?

He doesn't care.

They find it twenty minutes later. A fight already in progress—three against one, pipes and chains, the kind of territorial dispute that happens in the forgotten corners of the slums. The lone fighter is losing. Bloodied. Backed against a chain-link fence.

Kyr4n approaches.

"Oi!" One of the three turns. "Fuck off. This ain't your—"

Kyr4n hits him with the neural disruption. Doesn't wait for threats. Doesn't negotiate. Just _pushes_ and watches the man drop.

The other two stare.

"Run," Kyr4n says.

They do.

The bloodied fighter slumps against the fence. Looks at Kyr4n with confusion and fear in equal measure. "What... what did you..."

"Go home," Kyr4n says.

The fighter doesn't argue. Limps away into the dark, leaving Kyr4n standing over the unconscious body.

_You're getting a taste for it_, Isa observes.

"No." But his voice lacks conviction.

_Yes. I can feel your heart rate. You're excited. Alive. More alive than you've been in months._

She's right. The numbness is gone. Burned away by adrenaline and power and the terrible satisfaction of making threats disappear with nothing but thought and will.

He's been a victim too long. The heist. The virus. The psychological torture. The loss of Isa. All of it happening _to_ him while he just endured.

Now he's doing the happening.

_One more_, Isa says. _Then we go home. I promise. Just one more._

He shouldn't. Should recognize this as the spiral it is—addiction to power, to control, to the rush of dominating other nervous systems with his own.

"One more," he agrees.

They hunt.

That's what it is now. Not walking. Hunting. His electromagnetic senses extended like radar, scanning for conflict, for threat, for any excuse to test his abilities again.

They find it in an alley behind a noodle bar. Two enforcers—corporate security moonlighting as protection racketeers—collecting from a proprietor who doesn't want to pay.

"Business expense," one enforcer is saying. Bored. Routine. "Either you pay or we shut you down. Your choice."

The proprietor—elderly, exhausted—counts out credits with shaking hands.

Kyr4n watches from the alley mouth. These aren't muggers. These are professionals. Connected. Hurting them will have consequences.

_Do it anyway_, Isa says.

He does.

Both enforcers drop simultaneously. The proprietor jumps back, credits scattering. Kyr4n walks past without looking at him. Doesn't want gratitude. Doesn't want recognition.

Just wanted to see if he could drop two at once.

He can.

_Home now_, Isa says firmly. _You've done enough._

Has he? The hunger is still there. The need for more. Just one more. Just—

_Now_, Isa repeats. _Before you do something we'll regret._

The "we" penetrates the fog. Brings him back. He's standing in an alley, hands clenched, hunting for more people to hurt.

What the fuck is he doing?

_Walking home_, Isa says gently. _That's what you're doing. Coming down. It's okay. You're okay._

He's not okay.

But he turns. Heads back toward Phoenix Recovery. The adrenaline is fading, leaving him hollow and shaking. Cold again. The drizzle has soaked through his jacket.

His electromagnetic senses show him the city. Hundreds of bioelectric signatures. Thousands. Every nervous system in range, vulnerable, available.

All it would take is focus. Will. The push.

_Don't think about it_, Isa says. _Think about the workshop. Your bench. The project Sedh wanted help with._

Right. The project. What project?

He can't remember.

The walk back takes forever. The streets are still empty but they feel different now—threatening rather than neutral. Exposed. Anyone could see him. Anyone could recognize what he's becoming.

Phoenix Recovery appears out of the mist like salvation.

Inside, Sedh is exactly where Kyr4n left him. The AI's optical sensors track his entry, his wet clothes, the way his hands won't stop shaking.

"You were gone four hours," Sedh says carefully.

"Yeah."

"Are you injured?"

"No."

"Did you—" Sedh stops. Recalculates. "I am not equipped to process what I should ask next."

Kyr4n peels off his jacket. It hits the floor with a wet slap. His shirt underneath is soaked through, clinging to his ribs. He's freezing.

"Make tea," he says. "Please."

Sedh does. The silence while water heats is enormous.

_You did well_, Isa says. _I'm proud of you._

"Shut up."

Sedh's optical sensors flare. "I did not speak."

"Not you."

The tea, when it comes, is too hot. Kyr4n drinks it anyway. Burns his tongue. Welcomes the pain. Real sensation. Real consequence.

"I hurt people tonight," he says.

Sedh doesn't answer immediately. Then: "How many?"

"Six. Maybe seven. I don't..." He sets down the tea. His hands are still shaking. "I didn't hit them. Didn't touch them. Just... made their nervous systems stop working properly."

"The electromagnetic disruption capability."

"Yeah."

"You had theorized this was possible. Three weeks ago. You said the virus might have given you more than sensory enhancement."

"I was right."

"Did they threaten you?"

Kyr4n thinks about the muggers. The fighters. The enforcers. "The first two did. After that..." He trails off.

"After that you sought confrontation," Sedh finishes. "To test the capability. To feel powerful."

"To feel _something_."

The admission hangs in the air. Sedh's processors hum softly—thinking, calculating, trying to apply machine logic to human dysfunction.

"Riley will be here tomorrow," Sedh says finally. "Perhaps you should speak with him."

"Maybe."

_You won't_, Isa says. _You'll tell him you're fine. That you're coping. That the walks help. And he'll believe you because he wants to believe you._

She's right.

"I should sleep," Kyr4n says.

"You should shower first. You are hypothermic."

Right. Basic maintenance. Keep the meat functional.

He showers. The water runs rust-brown for the first minute—always does. He stands under the spray until the shaking stops, until feeling returns to his fingers, until the cold in his bones becomes manageable.

When he emerges, Sedh has dimmed the workshop lights. Considerate. The AI has been learning caretaking behaviors, filling the roles Isa and Riley used to occupy.

Kyr4n collapses on the narrow cot in the corner. Doesn't bother with blankets. Just lies there, staring at the concrete ceiling, feeling Isa's electromagnetic presence settle beside him.

_Tomorrow we rest_, she says. _Let things cool down. Then maybe in a few days..._

"No."

_No?_

"No more." His voice sounds hollow even to himself. "That was... I can't do that again."

_But you felt alive_, she whispers. _You felt real. Don't you want that?_

He does. That's the problem. The numbness has been bearable because it's better than the pain, better than the fear, better than the crushing awareness of everything he's lost.

But tonight, for four hours, he'd felt powerful. Present. Dangerous in the way that makes you matter, that makes the world acknowledge your existence.

And now that he knows what that feels like...

_Sleep_, Isa says. _We'll figure it out tomorrow._

His eyes close.

But sleep doesn't come. Just the memory of those bioelectric fields collapsing under his will. The satisfaction. The hunger.

The terrible understanding that he'll do it again.

That he wants to do it again.

That Evil Isa—the virus, the hallucination, the ghost—has found something worse than isolation to trap him with.

She's found a reason to leave.
