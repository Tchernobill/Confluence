The sensing radius hits eight meters on a Tuesday.

Kyr4n knows because he's been measuring. Obsessively. Each morning he places objects at specific distances—a broken commpad at five meters, a neural interface at six, a power cell at seven—and extends his electromagnetic awareness until the fields resolve clearly.

Yesterday: seven point three meters.

Today: eight point one.

"Your neural plasticity remains active," Sedh observes from the workbench. "The virus continues modifying your perceptual architecture."

"Yeah." Kyr4n doesn't look at the AI. He's focused on a medical scanner at the far edge of his range, watching its field pulse. He can sense individual components now. The battery. The processing core. The microscopic flows of current through circuit pathways.

Two weeks ago he'd only registered devices as unified signatures. Now he sees their anatomy.

_You're getting stronger_, Isa says. Pride in her voice. Always pride now.

He is getting stronger. Three more hunting trips since the first. Each time pushing further, testing limits. Last night he'd disrupted four people simultaneously—gang members trying to shake down a courier. Dropped them like puppets with cut strings.

The courier had run. Smart.

Kyr4n had stood over the bodies, feeling their nervous systems reboot, watching the electromagnetic patterns of consciousness reassemble. Fascinating. Educational.

Wrong.

He knows it's wrong. Knows he's spiraling. The hunting isn't about defense anymore. It's about the rush. The power. The way reality snaps into focus when he's threatening someone's autonomy with nothing but thought.

But knowing doesn't stop him.

"Riley arrives in forty minutes," Sedh says. "You should prepare a plausible explanation for your activities."

"I went for walks. Exercise. Fresh air."

"You returned at 4:17 AM. Your jacket had blood spatter. Not your blood."

Kyr4n had forgotten that. Sloppy. He'd gotten close enough to one target to be hit by the arterial spray when the man's nose broke. Hadn't even realized—been too focused on the electromagnetic signature of the skull fracturing.

"I'll tell him I saw a fight."

"You will lie to Riley." Not a question. Statement of fact.

"Yeah."

Sedh's optical sensors dim slightly. Disappointment, if AIs can feel that. "I had hoped you would choose differently."

"I don't care what you hoped."

The words come out harsher than intended. Kyr4n stands, paces. The workshop is too small again. Always too small now. The eight-meter sensing radius means he's constantly aware of the building's wiring, Sedh's processors, Mira in the medical bay, the neighbors' devices through the walls.

Too much input. Not enough distraction.

_You need out_, Isa says. _Riley will want to talk. Meditate. All that soft shit. You don't have time for it._

She's right. Riley will sense something wrong—he always does. Will ask questions with that gentle, persistent empathy that demands honest answers.

Kyr4n can't give honest answers.

Not about the hunting. Not about the bodies he's left twitching in alleys. Not about how good it feels to reduce another consciousness to pure pain with nothing but will.

"I'm going out," he says.

"Riley—"

"Tell him I'm running an errand. I'll be back."

He's gone before Sedh can protest.

The afternoon light is harsh after the workshop's dimness. Kyr4n squints, pulls his hood up. The eight-meter radius expands automatically, mapping the street. Dozens of bioelectric signatures. Devices everywhere. The city's electromagnetic skeleton visible in perfect detail.

He can sense a neural implant malfunctioning two buildings away. Can feel the exact moment someone three apartments over starts their coffee maker. Can track the bioelectric signature of a rat in the wall.

Too much.

_Focus_, Isa says. _You're scattered. Center yourself._

He tries. Narrows the radius deliberately, pulls it in to six meters. Five. Four. The noise recedes to manageable levels.

Better.

_Where are we going?_ Isa asks.

"Don't know. Somewhere busy."

_The market?_

He hasn't been to South Shore Central Market since before the virus. His old corner where he used to repair devices feels like someone else's memory. The Artisan. That quiet, careful person who just wanted to fix broken things.

That person is dead.

"Yeah. The market."

The walk takes thirty minutes. Long enough for his sensing radius to creep back out to seven meters. He doesn't fight it. Lets the information flow through his consciousness—every device, every nervous system, every electromagnetic whisper in range.

The market is chaos.

Hundreds of people compressed into six city blocks. Vendors shouting. Music clashing from competing stalls. Cooking smoke and ozone and unwashed bodies. And underneath it all, the electromagnetic symphony: thousands of devices, hundreds of bioelectric fields, all of it overlapping into a standing wave of noise that would have overwhelmed him two weeks ago.

Now it's just data.

He maps the crowd without trying. That woman has a cardiac implant—old model, wearing out. That man has military-grade neural enhancements—active duty or veteran. That teenager has a black-market pain suppressor running hot enough to cook her brain in five years.

Kyr4n sees all of it.

_You're staring_, Isa says. _People notice._

He blinks. Forces himself to actually look with his eyes instead of his electromagnetic senses. The market has changed. More security. More cameras. Corporate presence heavier than he remembers.

A response to the violence, probably. Six incidents in two weeks. Bodies left in alleys with unexplained neural trauma. The corporations care when it happens often enough.

_You should be careful_, Isa says. _Someone smart might connect the dots._

"No one knows what I can do."

_Yet._

Fair point.

He drifts through the market. Past his old corner—now occupied by someone else, a young woman repairing cheap handhelds with more enthusiasm than skill. Past the noodle bar where he used to buy lunch. Past Dr. Nyx's stall.

Dr. Nyx.

The old doctor is exactly where he's always been, selling gray-market pharmaceuticals and medical advice in equal measure. He looks up as Kyr4n approaches. Something flickers across his face—recognition, concern, calculation.

"Kyr4n." Careful. Neutral. "Haven't seen you in months."

"Been busy."

"So I hear." Dr. Nyx's eyes are sharp. Too sharp. "Strange things happening in the industrial sector. People dropping without being touched. Neural trauma without apparent cause."

Kyr4n's heart kicks. "That so?"

"Very strange. Almost like someone figured out how to weaponize an electromagnetic field." A pause. "You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?"

_Deny everything_, Isa hisses. _He's fishing._

"No idea," Kyr4n says. "Sounds like corp tech. Above my pay grade."

Dr. Nyx studies him. The silence stretches. Then: "You look thin. Exhausted. When's the last time Riley checked on you?"

"He's coming today."

"Good. You need someone." Another pause. "The virus. The one from the heist. It's still affecting you, isn't it?"

Kyr4n's electromagnetic senses flare automatically—reading Dr. Nyx's bioelectric field, his heart rate, the neural patterns. Looking for threat.

The doctor's field is elevated. Concerned. But also afraid.

Afraid of Kyr4n.

_He knows_, Isa says. _Or suspects. You should—_

"I'm managing," Kyr4n says. Steps back. "Thanks for the concern."

He turns. Walks away before Dr. Nyx can press further. Behind him, he senses the doctor's bioelectric field—elevated heart rate persisting, neural activity suggesting he's considering his next move.

Will he tell Riley? Contact the guild? Report to corporate security?

_You could stop him_, Isa says quietly. _Make sure he doesn't talk._

"No."

_Why not? He's a threat. You eliminate threats now._

"He's not—" Kyr4n stops. Corrects. "I'm not doing that."

_You've done worse._

She's right. He has. But there's a line between dropping muggers and enforcers and hurting someone like Dr. Nyx. Someone who helped him. Someone who represents the person he used to be.

Isn't there?

_The line is wherever you put it_, Isa says. _And you keep moving it._

Kyr4n pushes deeper into the market. Needs distraction. Needs to not think about Dr. Nyx's fear or the question of where the line actually is.

He finds distraction.

Three men. Corner of the market. Surrounding a fourth—smaller, younger, terrified. The bioelectric signatures tell the story: predators and prey. Professional shakedown. The prey has something valuable. The predators want it.

Standard market dynamics.

Kyr4n should walk past.

_You know you won't_, Isa says.

He approaches.

The three men notice him. The largest steps forward—warning posture, territorial display. "Move along. This is private business."

Kyr4n stops three meters away. Well within his sensing radius. He maps their fields—all three armed with implanted weapons, military-grade neural enhancements, combat experience visible in their bioelectric patterns.

Dangerous.

He smiles.

"Last chance," the large man says. "Walk away."

Kyr4n extends his awareness. Finds the man's nervous system. The neural pathways that govern motor control. The brainstem. The autonomous systems.

And _pushes_.

The man drops instantly. No scream. Just collapse—consciousness shut off like a switch.

The other two stare.

"The fuck—"

Kyr4n hits them both simultaneously. Eight meters of range means he doesn't need to move, doesn't need to gesture, doesn't need to do anything but think and will and push.

They fall.

The prey—the young man—stares at Kyr4n with naked terror. "What are you?"

Good question.

Kyr4n doesn't answer. He's focused on the three bodies at his feet. Watching their bioelectric fields. The large man's is chaotic—nervous system rebooting in random patterns. Inefficient. Sloppy.

Kyr4n can do better.

He kneels beside the man. Extends his hand—not touching, just hovering. Focuses his electromagnetic field into a tighter beam. More precise. More controlled.

And finds the heart.

The cardiac rhythm is there in perfect electromagnetic detail—sinoatrial node firing, electrical impulse propagating through the muscle, the synchronized contraction that pumps blood. Beautiful machinery. Vulnerable machinery.

_Don't_, Isa says. Warning now. Genuine alarm. _That's too far._

Is it?

Kyr4n probes the rhythm. Senses the exact frequency, the timing, the delicate balance that keeps the muscle contracting in coordinated fashion.

Wonders what happens if he disrupts it.

_Kyr4n_, Isa says sharply. _Step back. You're not a killer. Not yet._

Not yet. The caveat is telling.

The man's heart beats steadily. Sixty-eight beats per minute. Healthy. Strong.

All Kyr4n has to do is introduce chaos. Overwhelm the sinoatrial node's signal with electromagnetic noise. Force the cardiac muscle to fire randomly instead of in sequence.

Fibrillation.

Fatal in minutes without intervention.

_Please_, Isa whispers. _Don't make me watch this._

His hand is still hovering. The heart is right there. Available. Vulnerable.

"Hey!" Someone shouting. Security. "The fuck is going on here?"

The moment breaks.

Kyr4n stands. Pulls his electromagnetic field back. The three men remain unconscious but alive—hearts beating, lungs breathing, brains slowly rebooting.

He walks away.

The security guard—rent-a-cop, local hire, no real authority—doesn't follow. Smart man.

Kyr4n's hands are shaking. Not fear. Not guilt.

Disappointment.

He'd been so close. Close to finding out what happens when he pushes all the way. When he doesn't stop at pain or unconsciousness but goes further. Deeper. Into the autonomous systems that keep meat alive.

_You wanted to kill him_, Isa says. Not accusation. Observation.

"I was curious."

_That's worse. You know that's worse, right?_

He does. Scientific curiosity about murder is textbook psychopathy. But the word doesn't carry weight anymore. Just another label. Another way of describing what he's becoming.

He leaves the market. Walks without destination. The eight-meter sensing radius shows him the city in electromagnetic detail—every device, every nervous system, every beating heart in range.

All vulnerable.

All available.

All it takes is focus and will and the decision to push.

_You're scaring me_, Isa says quietly.

"You're not real. You can't be scared."

_Then you're scaring yourself._ A pause. _That's what I am, right? The part of you that still cares? Still knows this is wrong?_

He doesn't answer.

They walk.

An hour passes. Maybe two. The afternoon is dying, bleeding into evening. The drizzle starts again—that cold, persistent moisture that gets into everything.

Kyr4n's sensing radius expands to nine meters.

He notes it clinically. Maps the new range. Files it away for later testing.

Progress.

Evolution.

The virus rewriting his neurology day by day, giving him more power, more capability, more ways to hurt people without leaving evidence.

He should tell Sedh. Should let Mira run diagnostics. Should call Riley and admit everything—the hunting, the escalation, the moment at the market when he almost stopped a man's heart just to see what would happen.

Should.

Won't.

_Home_, Isa says. _Before you do something we can't take back._

"We?"

_You_, she corrects. _Before you do something you can't take back._

He turns toward Phoenix Recovery. The walk back is automatic, feet knowing the way. His electromagnetic senses map every person he passes. Every heartbeat. Every vulnerable nervous system.

He could drop them all. Simultaneously. Nine meters is enough range to hit a dozen people at once if they're clustered. Could walk through the slums like a plague, leaving bodies twitching in his wake.

Could.

Won't.

Not yet.

The thought should horrify him.

It doesn't.

Phoenix Recovery appears out of the mist. Inside: Sedh waiting. Riley probably still there, concern written in every bioelectric fluctuation of his field.

Kyr4n stops at the door. His hand on the cold metal. Nine meters of sensing radius showing him everything inside—Sedh at the workbench, Mira in the medical bay, Riley in the corner with a cup of tea going cold.

All of them worried about him.

None of them able to help.

_Ready?_ Isa asks.

"No."

_You'll fake it anyway. You're good at that now._

She's right.

He opens the door. Steps inside. Riley looks up—relief and concern mixing in his expression.

"Hey," Riley says. "Sedh said you went out. Everything okay?"

"Yeah. Just needed air."

The lie comes easily. Smooth. Practiced.

Riley studies him. Sees something—must see something—but doesn't push. "Want to meditate? Might help with the restlessness."

"Sure."

Another lie. He won't help. Nothing helps except the hunting. Except the feeling of reducing another consciousness to nothing but pain and fear and his will imposed on their meat.

But he sits. Crosses his legs. Closes his eyes. Listens to Riley's gentle instructions about breathing and centering and letting thoughts pass without attachment.

And underneath it all, Kyr4n's nine-meter sensing radius maps the building. Counts the heartbeats. Catalogs the vulnerable targets.

Waiting.

Growing.

Learning what it means to be apex predator in a city full of prey.

_Soon_, Isa whispers. _Soon you'll have to choose. How far you're willing to go. What you're willing to become._

He already knows the answer.

He just hasn't admitted it yet.
