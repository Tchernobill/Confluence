The darkness in Isa's container unit felt different than his utility room. Warmer. The soft hum of her climate control systems, the faint chemical-sweet scent of implant storage mixing with her perfume. He'd been staring at the corrugated ceiling for hours, tracking the subtle variations in the LED strips' glow as they cycled through their dim nighttime mode.

Three days. He'd spent three nights in her bed and still couldn't reconcile the reality of it—her breathing beside him, the weight of her arm across his chest, the casual intimacy that she treated as natural as air.

His internal clock said 04:47. Dawn would creep into the Stack levels in another hour, gray light filtering through the smog haze. He turned his head slowly, careful not to disturb her.

Isa lay on her side facing him, one hand tucked under her cheek. Her hair had fallen across her face, dark strands catching the ambient glow. The expression she wore in sleep—vulnerable, unguarded—made something tighten in his chest. The gold flecks in her eyes were hidden behind closed lids, but he remembered how they'd sparkled last night when she'd laughed at something he'd said about Sedh's latest philosophical tangent.

She'd laughed. At something _he_ said.

The reality of that still felt strange, like discovering a circuit behaved in ways the schematics never predicted. Kyr4n eased himself out of the bed with the precise control of someone who'd spent years moving through spaces where sound carried. His feet found the floor without sound. He pulled on his clothes—worn gray shirt, reinforced pants with their deep pockets—and knelt beside the bed.

Isa shifted slightly, her breathing pattern unchanging. The privacy curtain created a cocoon of amber light around the sleeping area, shadows playing across her features. Beautiful. The word surfaced in his mind unbidden, analytical and precise as any component specification. Beautiful in the way complex systems were beautiful—functional, elegant, more sophisticated than the sum of her parts.

He reached into his pocket, retrieved the small camera he'd modified from salvaged surveillance hardware. The lens extended with a whisper-quiet mechanical click. Through the viewfinder, he captured the moment—her peaceful expression, the way her hand curved against her cheek, the fall of her hair. Digital preservation of something he couldn't quite understand but didn't want to lose.

The image saved with a soft electronic chirp. He pocketed the camera and rose, movement fluid despite the confined space. His hand hesitated over her shoulder—an impulse to touch, to maintain contact—but he pulled it back. She needed sleep. He needed... something. Purpose. Motion. A problem to solve.

The kitchen area beckoned. Kyr4n moved through Isa's living space with the careful observation he applied to any new system. Small refrigeration unit. Induction cooktop that probably drew more power than the building's official allocation but functioned within acceptable parameters. Storage compartments built into the walls with the same attention to space efficiency that marked her business setup.

His mother's voice echoed from memory, patient and precise: _Mix the wet ingredients with the dry. Flour creates the structure. Everything else builds on that foundation._

Pancakes. Real pancakes, the kind his mother had made on the rare mornings when the utility room's makeshift stove cooperated and they had ingredients. Not the protein paste most slum residents ate. Not the nutrient bars that tasted like compressed cardboard and disappointment.

But pancakes needed eggs.

He pulled on his jacket, the one with the reinforced shoulders and the hidden pockets. His tools were second nature—multimeter in one pocket, probe set in another, the compact toolkit that never left his person. But this morning he wasn't hunting components.

The container's door protested with a faint squeal as he applied pressure. Kyr4n froze, waited, then continued with glacial slowness. The mechanism complained but the sound stayed below the threshold of waking someone. Years of moving through spaces where discovery meant danger had taught him patience. The door opened millimeter by millimeter until he could slip through.

He stepped out onto the metal grating walkway, seventh level of Block 12. The Stack stretched above and below him, a vertical city of corrugated metal and improvised modifications. Cooking fires flickered on lower levels. The air tasted like industrial exhaust and chemical processing, thick enough to coat his throat.

Dawn was beginning its slow reveal. Gray light, filtered through the permanent smog layer, turned everything monochrome. Kyr4n descended the external staircase, boots finding the familiar rhythm. Seven levels down. His mind tracked the route automatically while a different part of him replayed the image of Isa sleeping, peaceful and trusting.

She trusted him in her space. In her _bed_.

The thought still didn't fully parse.

The ground level market was already stirring. Vendors setting up makeshift stalls, the constant background noise of generators and voices. Kyr4n navigated the familiar paths, taking the route that cut through the electronics district. Past Chen's food distribution. Past the clusters of morning laborers heading to the industrial zones.

The crowd thickened as the morning shift approached. Kyr4n's attention dropped to ground level—not watching faces or torsos, but feet. The contact points. Where bodies committed to direction before the rest of the movement followed. A woman's boot angled left three steps ahead—he adjusted right. A child's quick shuffle indicated a dart forward—he created space. An old man's shuffling gait telegraphed his path—Kyr4n flowed around it.

Like pathfinding algorithms in dynamic environments. Calculate vectors, predict trajectories, optimize route efficiency. His body moved through the crowd with fluid precision that looked casual but required constant micro-adjustments.

Jeff's component shop occupied a corner of what had once been a metro station maintenance office. The sign—hand-painted with careful lettering—said "Surplus & Salvage" but everyone knew Jeff specialized in quality components from questionable sources. The kind of equipment that arrived without serial numbers or authentication codes.

The security grate was already rolled up. LED work lights illuminated the cluttered interior. Shelves lined every wall, packed with organized chaos—power supplies, junction boxes, processor arrays in static bags. The smell of solder and flux hung in the air, comfortable and familiar.

"Hi, Jeff."

Jeff looked up from his workbench, a broad-faced man in his forties with graying hair and the steady hands of someone who'd spent decades working with delicate electronics. His expression shifted through surprise to relief to genuine pleasure.

"Kyr4n." The name came out warm, almost paternal. "Hell, kid. Been wondering if you'd gotten yourself disappeared."

"Been... busy." Kyr4n moved into the shop, his posture relaxing fractionally. This was safe territory. Technical space. Jeff had never asked uncomfortable questions, never pushed beyond the professional boundary of vendor and customer.

"Busy's good. Busy pays bills." Jeff set down his soldering iron, attention fully focused. The kind of attention that made Kyr4n feel _seen_ in a way that was comfortable rather than threatening. "Got something good for you, actually. Remember that regulator you were asking about? High-efficiency, stable output across variable load conditions?"

Kyr4n's interest sharpened. "The military surplus unit? Thought those went to the Northside dealers."

"Most did." Jeff's smile had a conspiratorial edge. "But I know a guy who knows a guy. Pulled this one aside when the shipment came through. Figured if anyone could make use of it proper, be you and that special project of yours." He reached under the counter, produced a component in pristine condition—chrome casing, input/output terminals that showed no corrosion, manufacturer seals intact.

The regulator would be perfect for Sedh's power management. Eliminate the voltage fluctuations that occasionally caused processing delays. Kyr4n's fingers itched to test the specifications, verify the ratings, install the upgrade immediately.

But. Eggs.

"How much?" The question came automatically, but his attention had already shifted to the real problem.

"Eighty credits standard, but for you? Call it sixty. I know that project's important." Jeff's expression held genuine fondness. He'd never asked what Kyr4n was building, never pressed for details, just supported the work itself.

"Appreciate it." Kyr4n pulled out his credit chip, the one connected to his underground market accounts. "Do you... know where I could get eggs?"

The silence stretched. Jeff's hand paused midway through reaching for the payment terminal. His eyebrows rose slowly, the expression of a man recalculating every assumption he'd made.

"Eggs," Jeff repeated. Flat. Processing. "Like... biological eggs. From chickens."

"Yes."

"Kid, I sell electronics. Processors, power supplies, maybe some questionable medical scanners if you don't ask too many questions. I don't deal in—" He stopped. Tilted his head. "What kind of weird experiment you running? Trying to interface organic material with some kind of... I don't know, bioelectric project?"

Kyr4n's expression remained neutral, but something uncomfortable twisted in his chest. The assumption was logical. He'd never expressed interest in anything except technical problems and component specifications.

"Pancakes," he said. Simple. Factual. "Want to make pancakes."

Another beat of silence. Jeff's face cycled through confusion, disbelief, and then—understanding dawning with the sudden clarity of a completed circuit.

"Oh." Soft. Almost knowing. "Oh, hell. You met someone."

Kyr4n's jaw tightened. "The regulator—"

"You met someone special." Jeff's grin spread slowly, genuine pleasure mixing with something paternal. "Someone worth burning a week's income on a fancy breakfast." He shook his head, but the expression held no mockery. "Damn, kid. Never thought I'd see the day."

The uncomfortable feeling intensified. Kyr4n focused on the regulator, on the clean technical lines of its construction. "Do you know where to get eggs or not?"

Jeff studied him for a long moment. Whatever he saw in Kyr4n's face—the careful blankness, the slight tension in his shoulders, the way his fingers had automatically found the multimeter in his pocket—made his expression soften.

"Yeah," he said finally. "Yeah, I know a guy. Victor, runs a small operation two blocks over. Deals in specialty food supplies for the high-end dealers. Tell him Jeff sent you, he'll give you the friend rate." He paused. "Fair warning though—eggs are gonna run you maybe thirty, forty credits. Each. They're rare, real expensive. Like caviar expensive."

Forty credits. Each. Kyr4n did the math automatically. Two eggs would be eighty credits plus the regulator. His total liquid assets for the week. Gone on breakfast ingredients and a power supply.

But the image surfaced again—Isa sleeping, peaceful and trusting. The gold flecks in her eyes when she smiled. The casual way she'd touched his arm yesterday, natural as breathing.

"Thanks." He transferred the credits for the regulator, accepted the component and tucked it carefully into his jacket's inner pocket. The weight settled against his ribs, solid and reassuring.

Jeff was still grinning. "Victor's place is called 'Premium Stuff'—stupid name, I know. Green door, third stall past the water distribution point. Tell him you need eggs for pancakes. He'll either laugh at you or charge you extra for the story value."

"Bye, Jeff."

"Hey, Kyr4n?" Jeff's voice stopped him at the door. "Whoever they are? They're lucky. And I'm glad you found someone worth making pancakes for."

The words settled strange and heavy. Kyr4n nodded once—acknowledgment without commitment—and stepped back into the gray morning light.

The market had woken fully in the minutes he'd spent in Jeff's shop. The crowd flowed around him as he navigated toward the water distribution point. His attention dropped again to ground level—tracking foot placement, calculating trajectories. A vendor's heavy boots planted wide indicated stability, no sudden movement. A teenager's quick steps on the balls of their feet meant unpredictable darting. An enforcer's deliberate stride created a corridor others avoided.

Kyr4n flowed through it all like water finding optimal paths, his route constantly recalculating based on the contact points where feet met ground and intention became momentum.

The green door appeared through the crowd—exactly where Jeff had indicated. "Premium Stuff" in hand-painted letters, slightly faded. The stall behind it looked more permanent than most market operations, with actual walls instead of tarps and a refrigeration unit humming in the corner.

The man behind the counter—Victor, presumably—was thin and sharp-featured, with the calculating eyes of someone who'd spent years assessing what people could afford versus what they'd pay. He looked up as Kyr4n approached, expression shifting to polite commercial interest.

"Help you with something?"

"Jeff sent me. Need eggs." Kyr4n kept his voice level, matter-of-fact. "Two of them. And almond extract if you have it."

Victor's eyebrows rose fractionally. "Jeff, huh? That vouches for credit, at least." He disappeared into the back of his stall, returned with a small insulated container. "Fresh as you'll get in this sector. Forty credits each, cash or verified transfer."

"And the almond extract?"

"Ten credits. Small bottle." Victor produced it from under the counter—actual glass, with a label that showed minimal wear. "Most people use vanilla, you know."

"Have vanilla." Kyr4n pulled out his credit chip again, watching his available balance decrease with each transaction. The eggs went into a padded case Victor provided—"Free with purchase, I'm not a monster"—and the almond extract joined them.

"Pancakes, I'm guessing?" Victor's tone held curiosity without judgment. "Haven't seen anyone willing to pay that much for breakfast ingredients in a while."

Kyr4n said nothing, focused on securing the precious cargo in his jacket's inner pockets. The eggs settled with surprising weight. Fragile. Valuable. Breakable.

"Whoever they are," Victor said, his language carefully neutral, "that person better appreciate the gesture. That's three days of nutrition paste you just converted into one fancy meal."

The uncomfortable feeling had become familiar now. Kyr4n met Victor's eyes briefly—enough to acknowledge the transaction without inviting further conversation—and turned back toward the Stack.

The return journey felt different with the eggs secured against his chest. Each step required calculation, adjustment for the fragile cargo. The crowd pressed closer as the morning rush intensified. Workers heading to shifts. Vendors arguing about prices. Children running between stalls while parents shouted warnings.

Kyr4n's attention stayed locked on ground level. Boot placement. Weight distribution. Trajectory vectors. An old woman's shuffle left, two meters ahead—he adjusted his path. A child's bare feet, quick and erratic—he created a buffer zone. A security guard's heavy tread, moving with purpose—Kyr4n altered his route to maintain distance.

Each person's feet told him where they were going before they knew it themselves. The optimization ran continuously, pathfinding through dynamic obstacles, protecting the fragile cargo against his chest.

The eggs represented something beyond their monetary value—the difference between adequate nutrition and actual _food_, between survival and something approaching normal. Something his mother had given him in those brief moments when resources aligned.

Something he could give Isa.

The thought settled warm and strange in his chest as he climbed back up Block 12's external staircase. Seven levels up. His boots found the rhythm automatically. The container unit's door protested again—that same faint squeal—but he applied the lesson learned on exit. Glacial patience. Millimeter by millimeter. The sound stayed below threshold.

Inside, the amber LED glow remained dim. No sound from the sleeping area. Isa still asleep, still trusting him to move through her space without threat.

Kyr4n moved to the kitchen area, set his precious cargo on the counter with deliberate care. The eggs in their protective case. The almond extract beside them. He opened the refrigerator—the other ingredients still waiting where he'd noted them earlier. Flour in the pantry. Melk. Butter. Vanilla extract.

His mother's voice again, patient and precise: _The secret is in the timing. Mix it smooth but don't overwork the batter. Let it rest while the pan heats._

He found Isa's mixing bowl—clean, well-maintained, stored within easy reach. Located measuring cups. Started the methodical process of assembly. Flour first. Building the structure. Then the wet ingredients—melk, vanilla, almond extract creating an aromatic complexity his mother's recipe never had. He cracked the eggs with careful precision, watching the yolks slide perfect and golden into the bowl.

The shells went into Isa's waste receptacle. Evidence of the expense, the gesture, the choice to convert a week's income into a single meal.

The batter came together slowly. He whisked with patient precision, watching the ingredients combine into something cohesive. Set it aside to rest. Found Isa's pan, verified the induction cooktop's heat distribution. Reached for the butter—

The smell had changed. Not just flour and melk anymore. Something richer. Warmer. The eggs and almond extract creating an olfactory complexity that filled the space.

"Kyr?"

He turned. Isa stood at the edge of the sleeping area, hair sleep-mussed, wrapped in the oversized shirt she wore to bed. Her eyes—half-lidded, still adjusting to waking—tracked from him to the kitchen setup. Her nose wrinkled slightly, catching the scent. Not the flat chemical smell of powder mix pancakes. Something deeper.

She moved closer, drawn by curiosity. Her gaze swept the counter, cataloging details with the same assessment she brought to evaluating components. The mixing bowl. The measuring cups. The empty egg shells in the waste receptacle.

Her expression froze. Just for a moment. The gold flecks in her eyes caught the ambient light as understanding registered—not just what he was making, but what it cost. What those two fragile shells represented.

"What are you doing?" Her voice came out softer than the question warranted.

The answer stuck in his throat. Words weren't his strength. Technical specifications, component ratings, repair procedures—those he could articulate with precision. But _this_? Explaining why he'd spent ninety credits on breakfast ingredients because she'd smiled at him yesterday?

"Making pancakes," he said finally. Simple. Factual. Insufficient.

Isa said nothing. But her hand found his lower back, settled there with gentle pressure. Not demanding anything. Just... present. Connected. Her other hand gestured vaguely at the egg shells, the question unspoken but clear in the slight tremble of her fingers.

Kyr4n nodded once. Confirmation. Turned back to the stove. Started melting butter in the pan with careful attention to temperature distribution.

Behind him, Isa's breathing had gone quiet. Controlled. The kind of controlled that meant she was processing something too large for immediate words.

The batter bubbled at the edges. Kyr4n judged the timing, slid the spatula underneath, flipped with practiced precision. Golden brown. Perfect heat distribution. The smell intensified—sweet, warm, _good_ in a way that cut through all the industrial odors of the Stack.

"Kyr..." Her voice caught. Started again. "You didn't have to—"

"I know." He kept his attention on the pan. Safer than meeting her eyes. "Wanted to."

The hand on his back pressed firmer. Anchoring. The warmth of her presence at his side registered through all his careful defenses.

He flipped the pancake onto a plate. Started the second one. Let the simple competence of cooking ground him while Isa's presence anchored something he hadn't known needed anchoring.

The morning light was filtering through her windows now, turning the Stack's gray haze into something almost golden. And for the first time in three days of sleeping in her bed, Kyr4n felt like maybe—just maybe—he understood what she saw when she looked at him.

Not just useful skills or interesting problems to solve.

Something worth making pancakes for.
