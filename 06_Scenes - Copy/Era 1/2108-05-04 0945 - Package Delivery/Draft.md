Someone calls Kyr4n's name.

He pauses mid-solder, the iron tip hovering a millimetre from the circuit board. The voice comes from behind—unfamiliar cadence, warm timbre cutting through the market's constant hum. Nobody calls him by name here. He's "tech" to customers, anonymous to everyone else who matters.

The solder bead hardens unfinished. Kyr4n sets down the iron and turns.

A courier stands at the edge of his alcove, one hand resting on the strap of a messenger bag worn across his chest. Early twenties maybe, Kyr4n's age or close to it. Dark jacket patched at the elbows, cargo pants with reinforced knees. The kind of practical wear that comes from actual work, not affectation. His face carries an openness that shouldn't survive the slums—no edge of suspicion, no calculation in the steady gaze.

"Kyr4n?" the courier asks again. Not demanding confirmation. Just checking.

Kyr4n nods once. His throat feels tight.

"Riley King. Got some packages for you." Riley's smile comes easy, reaching his eyes. "They're on my bike—didn't want to haul them through the crowd without confirming you're here first. Mind walking over?"

The request is reasonable. Packages for repairs, and the components he'd ordered for the android head. But Kyr4n's pulse kicks up anyway, that old instinct that says interaction means exposure, exposure means vulnerability. He studies Riley's posture—relaxed, patient, no impatience in the way he stands. Waiting for an answer but not pressing.

"Where?" Kyr4n's voice comes out softer than intended.

"Three rows over. Near the noodle cart." Riley gestures toward the market's west side. "Won't take long."

Kyr4n glances at his workbench. The half-finished board can wait. He reaches for the tarp folded beneath the bench, drapes it over his tools with practiced efficiency. The motion reveals the corner of the android head he'd been working on last night—Sedh's optical sensors catch the dim light for a moment before the tarp settles.

Riley's eyes flick to it. A brief widening, curiosity without judgment.

Kyr4n tucks the tarp's edges down and straightens. "Okay."

They move into the market's flow. Riley navigates the crowd with the ease of someone who knows these spaces—not rushing, but finding the gaps where bodies naturally part. Kyr4n follows half a step behind, close enough to not lose sight of him but distant enough to maintain separation. The morning chill hasn't burned off yet. Breath mists in the air between container walls.

"Been delivering around here about three weeks," Riley says over his shoulder. Not looking back, giving Kyr4n space. "Covering the market sector this month. You're the first order I've had trouble finding—most vendors have stall numbers, but your listing just said 'southeast corner alcove.'"

"Didn't know there'd be deliveries." The words come easier now, following Riley's back instead of facing him directly. "Usually pick things up myself."

"Dr. Nyx put in the special request. Said you'd need them soon." Riley ducks under a low-hanging tarp. "She speaks highly of you. 'Best hands in the slums' was the exact phrase."

Heat creeps up Kyr4n's neck. Praise always sits wrong on him, like clothes that don't quite fit. "She exaggerates."

"Maybe. Or maybe you're just used to being better at this than everyone else thinks." Riley's tone stays light, conversational. No weight to it, no hidden agenda Kyr4n can sense. Just observation.

They emerge near the noodle cart. The smell of broth and fried garlic cuts through the market's usual mix of welding flux and lubricant oil. Riley's bike leans against a support strut—older model courier bike, reinforced frame, cargo holder welded to the rear. Practical. Well-maintained despite its age.

Riley unstraps the cargo holder's cover. "So, half of these are labeled 'repair supplies,' half are 'personal project.' Want to check them before I unload? Make sure nothing got damaged in transit?"

Kyr4n steps closer. Six packages total, wrapped in brown synth-paper, each one marked with his name in Dr. Nyx's precise handwriting. His chest tightens at seeing it—that familiar script, the way she forms the 'y' with a little tail. His mother used to write like that.

He pushes the thought away. "They look fine."

"Cool. I've got a bag you can use. Just need it back next time I swing through." Riley reaches into the cargo holder—

The bike makes a sound.

Wrong sound. Not the mechanical tick of cooling metal or the soft hiss of hydraulics settling. Something underneath those. A buzz that shouldn't be there, irregular pulse in the electrical system. Kyr4n's awareness narrows, his focus shifting the way it does when a device speaks its problems directly into his nervous system.

Not a sound, exactly. He _feels_ it.

"Your bike," Kyr4n says. The words come before conscious thought.

Riley pauses, half-turned, packages in his hands. "What about it?"

"Power distribution. Something's wrong." Kyr4n crouches beside the bike, fingers hovering over the frame. The buzz shivers through the metal, micro-vibrations that whisper of dust and carbon scoring and eventual catastrophic failure. "You been losing power? Occasional stuttering when you accelerate?"

Riley sets down the packages carefully. His expression shifts—not defensive, but attentive. "Yeah, actually. Started maybe two days ago. Thought it was just the battery getting old."

"It's not the battery." Kyr4n runs his palm along the frame, mapping the electrical pathways by touch and instinct. The wrongness pulses stronger near the core assembly. "Can I look?"

"Sure." No hesitation. Riley steps back, giving Kyr4n room. "You know bikes?"

"I know systems." Kyr4n pulls his multi-tool from his pocket—worn carbon composite, blade scarred from a thousand repairs. The bike's access panel requires a hex key. He selects the right size without looking, muscle memory guiding his hands. Three bolts. The panel comes free.

The core assembly sits exposed. Compact fusion cell, power distribution board, cooling system with its network of micro-channels. And there—the air filter housing. The synthetic mesh shows a tear along one edge, maybe five millimeters long. Small enough to miss on casual inspection. Large enough to let the slums inside.

"See this?" Kyr4n points to the tear without touching it. "Filter's ruptured. Dust got into the core."

Riley leans closer, careful not to crowd Kyr4n's space. "Shit. How bad?"

Kyr4n doesn't answer immediately. He angles his head, letting the light from a nearby vendor's lamp catch the interior. The power distribution board gleams with a thin coating of gray-black dust. It's settled into the channels between components, accumulated around solder points. And there—a scorch mark, barely visible, where the dust bridged two contacts.

"You've been getting sparks." Kyr4n traces the air above the board, mapping the damage without disturbing it. "Dust conducts just enough to arc across the power traces. That's your stuttering—brief losses of power when the arc grounds out. If it keeps building up, eventually you'll get a sustained short. Could fry the whole distribution system."

"Can you fix it?" Riley's voice stays calm, but Kyr4n catches the underlying concern. A courier's bike isn't just transportation. It's livelihood.

"Need to power it down first." Kyr4n glances up. "Full shutdown, not standby. Ten seconds."

Riley reaches for the ignition, fingers moving with practiced efficiency. The bike's soft hum dies. The sudden silence feels loud.

Kyr4n waits, counting heartbeats, letting the residual charge bleed out. Then he leans in.

The multi-tool has a soft brush attachment for exactly this—cleaning dust from delicate electronics. He extends it, the bristles fanning out like synthetic fiber optics. The first pass across the board lifts a cloud of gray dust. Kyr4n works slowly, systematically, each stroke following the board's geometry. Muscle memory again. The android head's restoration taught him patience, the value of working at the component's pace rather than his own impatience.

"The dust is conductive?" Riley asks. Not doubting, just wanting to understand.

"Partially." Kyr4n keeps his eyes on the work, but the question feels different from the usual customer queries. Riley genuinely wants to know, not just have the problem fixed. "It's got metallic particulates—industrial runoff from the fabrication shops. In small amounts, it won't matter. But this much, concentrated in the right places, it creates paths for current where there shouldn't be any."

"Like little bridges."

"Exactly like that." Kyr4n finishes the first pass, examines the board. Better, but not clean enough. He makes a second pass, slower, getting into the corners where dust loves to hide. "The sparks you saw—those were the dust burning off when the current got high enough. But it keeps accumulating faster than it burns."

"So it would just get worse."

"Until something failed completely. Probably the distribution board. Maybe the fusion cell's regulator if you were unlucky." Kyr4n sits back, letting his wrist rest. The board looks clean now, the scorch mark still visible but no longer dangerous. "Seen bikes brick themselves from less."

Riley's quiet for a moment. Then: "How'd you know? Just from that sound?"

Kyr4n hesitates. The truth feels too exposed—that systems speak to him in ways they don't speak to others, that he doesn't think about diagnostics so much as feel them. But Riley's question doesn't carry the usual edge of suspicion that comes with admitting unusual abilities.

"Practice," Kyr4n says finally. Partial truth. "You work on enough systems, you learn what healthy sounds like. Everything else is variation on broken."

"Huh." Riley's tone carries something that might be respect. "That's actually a really good way to think about it."

Kyr4n returns to the bike. The air filter needs temporary patching—he can't replace it here, doesn't have the parts. But he's got electrical tape in his pocket, always does. He tears off a strip, presses it over the tear with careful pressure. Not a permanent fix, but it'll hold until Riley can get a proper replacement.

"This'll last maybe a week," Kyr4n says, smoothing the edges down. "You need to get a real filter soon. The tape will degrade in the cold, and even before that, it's not a perfect seal. More dust will get in, just slower."

"Where should I get one?" Riley pulls out a small tablet from his jacket, stylus ready. "You have a supplier you recommend?"

The question catches Kyr4n off-guard. Most people just nod and forget. Riley's already writing notes, taking this seriously.

"Nakamura's shop. Two sectors east, near the old train depot." Kyr4n reattaches the access panel, threading bolts back into place. "Tell them you need a Hayashi-series filter, model 4-7-J. If they try to upsell you on premium mesh, ignore it. Standard's fine for courier work."

Riley's stylus scratches across the tablet. "Hayashi 4-7-J, standard mesh, Nakamura's. Got it." He looks up, meets Kyr4n's eyes directly. "Thank you. Seriously. I'd have just kept riding it until it died."

"You would've been stranded somewhere." Kyr4n tightens the last bolt, tests the panel's seal. Secure. "Probably in the cold."

"Yeah." Riley's smile comes back, quieter now but no less genuine. "Instead I'm here, bike working, talking to someone who actually explains what's wrong instead of just telling me it's complicated and I wouldn't understand."

The words land strange. Kyr4n stands, pocketing his multi-tool. "It's not complicated. Just specific."

"Most people can't tell the difference." Riley tucks the tablet away. "They use 'complicated' as a shield. Makes them feel smart, makes the customer feel dumb." He pauses, then adds: "You don't do that. You explain it in a way that makes sense. That's... actually kind of rare."

Heat creeps up Kyr4n's neck again. He looks away, focusing on the bike's frame instead of Riley's face. "You can start it. Should be fine."

Riley keys the ignition. The bike hums to life—smooth, clean, none of that wrong vibration Kyr4n had felt before. The power flows steady now, no interruptions, no sparks arcing in the dark. Riley's shoulders drop slightly, tension Kyr4n hadn't noticed releasing.

"Perfect." Riley grins. "You just saved my week. How much do I owe you?"

Kyr4n shakes his head. "Nothing. It was ten minutes."

"Ten minutes that would've cost me a brick bike and a whole day of lost deliveries." Riley reaches for his messenger bag, then pauses. Studies Kyr4n's expression. Not assessing the way some customers did—looking for value, for usefulness. This feels different. Like Riley's trying to understand what kind of person turns down payment for skilled work.

After a moment, Riley's hand drops. His smile shifts—still warm, but with something deeper underneath. Understanding, maybe. Respect for the boundary Kyr4n's drawing.

"Okay," Riley says quietly. "Thank you."

The simplicity of it catches Kyr4n off-guard. No argument, no insistence, no wounded pride at having a favor refused. Just acceptance and gratitude.

Riley pulls out the large cloth bag he'd mentioned, starts loading Kyr4n's packages. The motion is careful, practiced—each package settled with attention to weight distribution. When he hands it over, Kyr4n finds the balance point immediately, the load perfectly centered.

"So," Riley says, angling his head toward the market behind them, "that project under your tarp. The one with the glowing eyes. You building something?"

Kyr4n tenses. But Riley's tone stays curious, open. No threat in it. No judgment.

"Restoring something," Kyr4n says carefully. "Android head. Found it in salvage."

"That's ambitious." Riley swings his leg over the bike. "Most people would just strip it for parts."

"Most people don't..." Kyr4n trails off. Don't what? Don't hear the potential in broken things? Don't feel compelled to repair what others discard? He settles for: "I like fixing things."

Riley's smile shifts—still warm, but with something deeper underneath. Understanding, maybe. "I get that. There's something satisfying about taking broken things and making them work again." He settles into the bike's seat, testing the throttle. The engine responds smoothly. "Okay. I've got six more stops before lunch, but I'll be back through this sector in a few days. More deliveries coming?"

Kyr4n nods. "Probably. Still sourcing parts."

"Cool. I'll keep an eye out for your name." Riley pauses, then adds: "Hey, if you ever need anything couriered—parts, supplies, whatever—just leave word with Dr. Nyx. She knows how to reach me. I run this sector Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays."

The offer sits in the air between them. It's more than professional courtesy. It's the start of something—connection, routine, relationship. The things Kyr4n usually avoids.

But Riley makes it feel easy. Natural. Like friendship could be as simple as a regular delivery route.

"I'll remember that," Kyr4n says.

"Good." Riley kicks the bike's stand up. "Thanks again for the save. That was seriously precise work—most repair techs I deliver to just hope things hold together. You actually care about the craft."

The words echo in Kyr4n's head as Riley pulls away, the bike's clean hum disappearing into the market's noise. He stands there for a moment, the bag of packages heavy in his hands, watching Riley's jacket fade into the crowd.

You actually care about the craft.

Nobody's said that to him before. Recognition of what the work means, not just what it accomplishes. And Riley had noticed the way Kyr4n explained things, appreciated the respect in it. No condescension, no dumbing down. Just translation.

Kyr4n turns back toward his alcove. The morning's chill has burned off a little, but the space between his shoulder blades still feels warm, like someone's watching. He glances back once. Catches sight of Riley two rows over, laughing with a noodle vendor while collecting another package.

Easy. Riley makes everything look easy—the navigation through crowds, the casual conversation, the way he'd trusted Kyr4n with his bike without hesitation. And somehow, being around him had been easy too. The usual tightness in Kyr4n's chest had loosened. The constant calculation of threat and distance had quieted.

His mother used to say some people carried peace with them, wore it like an extra skin. Kyr4n never understood what she meant until now.

Back at his alcove, he sets the bag down and pulls back the tarp. The android head sits where he left it, optical sensors dark now but waiting. Beneath the general deliveries, he finds the packages marked 'personal project'—power regulators, optical processors, two spools of micro-wire. Everything he needs to move forward with Sedh's restoration.

He opens the first package, examining the regulator's housing for damage. Perfect condition. Dr. Nyx always sources quality parts. But as he works, his mind keeps drifting back to Riley. To the easy smile, the genuine curiosity, the way he'd listened to Kyr4n's explanation without impatience or pretense.

Most people made Kyr4n tired. The constant management of boundaries, the navigation of social expectations he didn't fully understand. But Riley hadn't felt like work.

Kyr4n picks up his soldering iron, tests the tip's temperature. The iron for the earlier repair has cooled. He waits for it to heat again, watching the temperature gauge climb.

Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Riley would be back through the sector. Regular as the changing light, reliable as the market's rhythms.

The iron reaches temperature. Kyr4n leans over the half-finished board, positions the tip, and completes the solder bead he'd abandoned when Riley called his name. The connection flows smooth and clean, a perfect join.

Around him, the market continues its constant noise. Vendors calling prices, customers haggling, the distant clang of metal against metal. But underneath it all, Kyr4n notices the absence of that wrong sound, that electrical buzz that shouldn't have been there.

Fixed. One small repair that prevented larger failure.

His mouth twitches. Not quite a smile, but close enough.

Outside the alcove, the morning light shifts, catching dust motes in its beam. They drift and swirl, following currents Kyr4n can't see but knows are there—the breath of bodies moving through space, the whisper of thermal gradients, the invisible architecture that makes the market work.

He finishes the board repair, sets it aside to cool. Reaches for the next project. There's always another project.

But now there's also Riley. And somehow, that doesn't feel like a burden.

It feels like possibility.
