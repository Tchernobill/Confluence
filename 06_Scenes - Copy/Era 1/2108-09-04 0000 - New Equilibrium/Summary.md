### Part 1: The Morning After & The Disappearance
**Location:** Phoenix Recovery (Living Quarters & Workshop)
*   **Event:** Isa wakes up hungover in bed with Riley; they are physically affectionate.
*   **Event:** Riley rushes off for a courier delivery.
*   **Event:** Isa enters the workshop expecting to find Kyr4n.
*   **Beat:** Isa discovers the workshop is sterile and empty; Kyr4n has cleaned everything and vanished.
*   **Event:** Isa attempts to comm Kyr4n; the call times out/is ignored.
*   **Beat:** Isa feels a mix of worry and self-centered fear (that she is too much trouble).

### Part 2: The Market Confrontation
**Location:** South Shore Underground Market (The "Gut")
*   **Event:** Isa tracks Kyr4n to a dangerous black-market sector (despite the "Enforcer Kane" threat).
*   **Event:** She finds Kyr4n buying servos, seemingly calm and detached.
*   **Beat:** Kyr4n engages the "Protective Mask," treating Isa with cold, polite indifference.
*   **Event:** Isa confronts him about leaving; Kyr4n lies, claiming he slept fine and heard nothing.
*   **Beat:** Kyr4n "hands in his resignation" by telling Isa she has Riley to watch her back now.
*   **Event:** Kyr4n physically disengages and disappears into the crowd, leaving Isa stunned.

### Part 3: The Realization
**Location:** The "Neon Dreg" Café
*   **Event:** Isa meets Riley urgently after his run.
*   **Event:** Isa relays Kyr4n’s cold behavior and his comment about Riley watching her back.
*   **Beat:** Riley realizes the physical reality: The partition walls are thin. Kyr4n heard them having sex the previous night.
*   **Beat:** They understand that Kyr4n didn't just "not mind"—he was faking sleep while listening to them, confirming his belief that he is being replaced.
*   **Event:** Riley declares they need to fix this immediately before Kyr4n does something reckless.

### Part 4: The Search
**Location:** Split Locations
*   **Event:** Isa checks the old ventilation shaft hideout; she finds it empty and dusty.
*   **Beat:** Isa realizes Kyr4n isn't "hiding/pouting"—he is "resigning" from their lives entirely.
*   **Event:** Riley goes to the Phoenix Recovery workshop.

### Part 5: The Intervention
**Location:** Phoenix Recovery Workshop
*   **Event:** Riley enters and finds Kyr4n working on Sedh (the android head), acting aggressively normal.
*   **Event:** Kyr4n tries to dismiss Riley with "customer service" politeness and technical jargon.
*   **Beat:** Riley refuses to accept the facade; he physically turns off the soldering iron and forces Kyr4n to face him.
*   **Beat:** Kyr4n breaks down, admitting he feels like "infrastructure" or a placeholder compared to Riley’s energy.
*   **Beat:** Riley validates Kyr4n’s worth, insisting he isn't an upgrade but a necessary part of the triad.
*   **Event:** Riley pulls a resistant Kyr4n into a fierce hug.
*   **Beat:** Kyr4n finally cracks, shedding a single tear and clinging to Riley.

### Part 6: The Reconciliation
**Location:** Phoenix Recovery Workshop
*   **Event:** Isa bursts in, terrified Kyr4n had left for good.
*   **Beat:** She sees the hug and realizes the immediate crisis is averted.
*   **Event:** Isa joins the conversation, apologizing for her thoughtlessness.
*   **Beat:** Isa reframes Kyr4n’s self-perception: He isn't "infrastructure," he is the "foundation."
*   **Event:** Isa kisses Kyr4n on the forehead—a gesture of claiming and protection, not sexuality.
*   **Beat:** The tension breaks; they joke about "voiding the warranty."

### Part 7: The New Equilibrium
**Location:** Phoenix Recovery Living Quarters
*   **Event:** The trio retreats to the bedroom, exhausted.
*   **Event:** Riley takes the top bunk; Kyr4n takes the bottom bunk.
*   **Event:** Isa climbs into the small bottom bunk with Kyr4n.
*   **Beat:** Kyr4n protests space issues, but Isa insists she needs the contact (and knows he does too).
*   **Event:** Riley jokes that he would join them if the bed were bigger.
*   **Beat:** Final Image: Kyr4n sandwiched between the wall and Isa, with Riley above, accepting that for now, he is safe and wanted.
