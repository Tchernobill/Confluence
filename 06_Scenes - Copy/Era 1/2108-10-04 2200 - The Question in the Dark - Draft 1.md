# "The Question in the Dark"

_One month after the reconciliation. Isa's at her own place for the night. The workshop is quiet except for the server hum._

---

The bed had gotten easier.

Not comfortable—Kyr4n still slept rigid as a circuit board most nights—but _easier_. The shape of Riley beside him had become familiar. The rhythm of his breathing. The occasional unconscious sprawl of his arm. The way he generated heat like a small furnace.

Tonight they'd both been quiet. Riley had come back from a long run, showered, and climbed into bed with barely ten words exchanged. Kyr4n had been reading technical documentation on his tablet until his eyes burned, then set it aside.

Now they lay in the dark, side by side, not quite touching. The comfortable distance of people who'd learned each other's sleep patterns.

Kyr4n stared at the ceiling. Counted server pulses. Tried to let his mind settle.

It didn't settle.

He turned his head on the pillow, studying Riley's profile in the dim light. His eyes were closed, his breathing even but not quite deep enough for sleep.

"Riley?" Kyr4n whispered.

"Mm?" Not asleep. Not even close.

Kyr4n's heart kicked against his ribs. He'd been thinking about this for weeks. Cataloging data points. Running analyses. The question had been building in his head like pressure in a sealed system, and now—now in the dark, when he didn't have to see Riley's face clearly—it finally cracked through.

"Are you attracted to me?"

Riley's eyes snapped open.

For one second, he went absolutely still.

Then he jerked up so fast he nearly did fall out of bed, catching himself with one hand on the mattress, the other flailing for balance. "What? I—_what?_"

Kyr4n stayed flat on his back, his heart hammering. "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have—"

"No, no, wait." Riley twisted to face him, sitting cross-legged now, one hand running through his hair. "You just—you can't just _ask_ that out of nowhere, man. I almost had a heart attack."

"Sorry," Kyr4n repeated, quieter. He started to turn away. "Forget I—"

"Kyr. Hey." Riley's hand landed on his shoulder, gentle but firm. "Don't do that. Don't shut down. I'm not upset, I'm just—you surprised me."

Kyr4n stayed on his back, staring up at Riley's silhouette. His chest felt tight. "I've been thinking about it. For a while. I needed to know."

Riley was quiet for a moment, his hand still on Kyr4n's shoulder. Then he let out a long breath and settled back down, lying on his side now, facing Kyr4n. Close enough to talk quietly, but not crowding.

"Yeah," Riley said finally, his voice soft. "Yeah, I am. I have been. For a while."

Kyr4n's breath caught. He'd expected denial. Deflection. Not... confirmation.

"I thought..." Riley continued, a rueful note entering his voice. "I mean, I've been dropping hints since practically the beginning. I thought you either weren't interested or were ignoring it to be polite."

"Hints." Kyr4n's analytical brain kicked in, processing. "The... comments about watching me work?"

"Yeah."

"And when you said I looked 'good in that shirt' last month?"

"Yep."

"The time you touched my hair and said it was 'soft'?"

Riley huffed a quiet laugh. "Guilty."

Kyr4n stared at the ceiling. "I thought those were just... things you said. Casual observations."

"Ky." Riley's voice was gentle, amused. "I don't tell most guys their hair is soft."

"I didn't know the parameters." Kyr4n's hands found each other on his chest, fingers lacing together. "I couldn't tell if you were flirting or just being... you. You're tactile with everyone. You compliment Isa constantly. I thought maybe that was just how you communicated."

"Fair," Riley admitted. "I am pretty physical with people I care about. But..." He paused, searching for words. "There's a difference. The way I touch Isa, the things I say to her—that's one thing. But with you, it's..." He trailed off.

"Different," Kyr4n supplied.

"Yeah. Different." Riley shifted slightly closer. "More careful. More... I don't know. Deliberate? Like I'm checking if it's okay every time."

Kyr4n turned his head on the pillow, finally looking at Riley directly. In the dim light, he could just make out his expression—open, a little uncertain, but honest.

"Why didn't you just ask?" Kyr4n said. "Directly."

Riley smiled, sad and knowing. "Because you barely believe that Isa wants you, Ky. How was I supposed to drop 'hey, I'm also attracted to you' on top of that?" He shook his head. "You were already drowning. I wasn't going to add weight."

Something in Kyr4n's chest cracked open. "I've been getting most of them," he admitted, his voice barely above a whisper. "The hints. I just... I couldn't process it. I kept thinking I was misreading the data."

"You weren't misreading anything."

"But I didn't know what to do with it." Kyr4n's hands tightened on each other. "I've never... I've never been with a man before. I've never even thought about it as a possibility until recently. And even now, I don't know what it means. I don't know what I'm supposed to feel or want or—" He stopped, frustrated with his own inability to articulate. "I don't have a map for this."

Riley was quiet for a moment. Then, carefully: "Do you want a map? Or are you asking because you're curious?"

"I don't know," Kyr4n admitted. "Both? Neither? I just know that when you touch me, it feels different than when Isa touches me. Not bad. Just... different. And I notice you. The way you move. The way you look at me sometimes. And I can't tell if I'm noticing because you're attractive or because I'm attracted, and I don't know how to figure it out."

"Okay." Riley's voice was steady, patient. "That's okay. You don't have to figure it out right now."

"But you've been dropping hints for months."

"Yeah, for fun. Because I like making you blush." Riley's tone was gentle, teasing. "But I'm not expecting anything, Ky. I'm not sitting here waiting for you to suddenly realize you're into guys and jump me or whatever." He shifted onto his back, staring up at the ceiling alongside Kyr4n. "I'm attracted to you. That's true. But that doesn't mean you owe me anything. It doesn't change what we have."

Kyr4n absorbed that. Tested it for logic traps. Found none.

"What if I wanted to try?" he asked quietly. "Figuring it out?"

Riley went very still. "Try... what, exactly?"

"I don't know." Kyr4n's voice was frustrated. "That's the problem. I don't know what trying would even look like. Or if I'd be any good at it. Or if I'd like it. Or if—"

"Kyr. Hey." Riley turned his head, meeting Kyr4n's eyes in the dark. "Breathe. You're spiraling."

Kyr4n forced himself to slow down. Inhale. Exhale. "Sorry."

"Don't apologize." Riley smiled, soft and reassuring. "Look, there's no timeline here. No test you have to pass. If you're curious, we can... I don't know. Take it slow? See what feels right? And if it doesn't feel right, that's fine too."

"But what about Isa?"

"What about her?"

"Does she know you're attracted to me?"

Riley huffed. "Kyr, Isa probably figured it out before I did. She's not exactly blind. And she's never said anything negative about it." He paused. "Actually, she once asked me if I'd made a move yet, and when I said no, she called me a coward."

Despite everything, Kyr4n felt his mouth twitch. "She would."

"Right?" Riley laughed quietly. "So no, that's not a problem. If anything, she'd probably be thrilled." His voice softened. "But this isn't about her. This is about you. What you want. What you're comfortable with."

Kyr4n was quiet for a long moment, processing. His analytical mind wanted clear parameters, defined variables, a step-by-step protocol. But this wasn't a circuit diagram. It was messier than that.

"I don't know what I want," he said finally. "But I know I don't want to keep pretending I haven't noticed. That feels dishonest."

"Okay." Riley's voice was warm. "Then let's start there. No pretending. I'm attracted to you. You've noticed. And you're... figuring out how you feel about that. Yeah?"

"Yeah."

"And in the meantime, we just keep being us. Hanging out. Talking. Sleeping in the same bed like we do every week." Riley's hand found Kyr4n's on the mattress—not grabbing, just resting alongside. "Nothing has to change unless you want it to."

Kyr4n looked at their hands. Riley's was bigger, rougher. His own was thin, scarred from solder burns. They weren't touching, but they were close. Close enough that he could feel the warmth.

Slowly, carefully, Kyr4n shifted his pinky finger to rest against Riley's.

It was barely contact. Barely anything at all.

But Riley's hand turned, his fingers loosely curling around Kyr4n's. Not holding. Just... there.

"Is this okay?" Riley murmured.

Kyr4n's heart was pounding, but not from fear. From something else. Something he didn't have a name for yet.

"Yeah," he whispered. "It's okay."

They lay like that in the silence. Hands loosely linked. Side by side in the dark.

"For what it's worth," Riley said after a while, his voice drowsy now, "I'm glad you asked. Even if you did almost give me a heart attack."

Kyr4n felt something in his chest ease. "Sorry about that."

"Nah." Riley squeezed his hand gently. "Worth it."

The server lights pulsed their steady rhythm. Green, amber, green.

Outside, the slum settled into its nightly hum—distant generators, the occasional shout, the rumble of transport vehicles.

Inside, two people lay in the dark, fingers barely touching, something new and fragile taking shape between them.

"Riley?" Kyr4n whispered after a while.

"Mm?"

"Thank you. For being patient."

Riley's thumb brushed across his knuckles. "Always, Ky. Get some sleep."

Kyr4n closed his eyes.

The fracture was still there—smaller now, maybe. Or at least better mapped.

And for the first time in months, he fell asleep without counting server pulses.

He fell asleep holding someone's hand.

## Why This Scene Works:

### **Character Voice Consistency:**

**Kyr4n:**

- Asks the direct, analytical question out of nowhere (been processing for weeks)
- "I don't have a map for this" / "I can't process it" language
- Admits he notices the hints but can't interpret them
- Spirals when trying to figure out "what trying would look like"
- The tiny pinky-finger touch = his careful, incremental approach

**Riley:**

- The dramatic near-fall reaction (warm, physical humor)
- Immediately reassures once he recovers
- "I've been dropping hints since the beginning" with gentle exasperation
- "For fun. Because I like making you blush" = his playful approach
- "Nothing has to change unless you want it to" = patient, no pressure
- Mentions Isa calling him a coward (realistic detail)

### **Relationship Dynamics:**

1. **Asymmetrical awareness**: Riley has been aware and dropping hints; Kyr4n has been noticing but unable to process
    
2. **No pressure resolution**: Riley explicitly says he's not expecting anything, which allows Kyr4n to explore without performance anxiety
    
3. **The Isa factor**: Addressed naturally—she knows, she's fine, she's probably pushing for it
    
4. **Physical progression**: From no touch → hands near each other → pinky contact → loose hand-holding. Glacial pace that respects Kyr4n's processing speed
    
5. **The "never been with a man" revelation**: Handled without drama—just Kyr4n being honest about his confusion
    

### **Emotional Beats:**

- Initial question = vulnerability
- Riley's reaction = humor breaking tension
- Confirmation = honest acknowledgment
- Discussion of hints = gentle teasing
- Kyr4n's confusion = authentic processing
- Riley's patience = emotional safety
- Hand-holding = tiny step forward
- Ending = peaceful, no resolution required

### **What's Left Unresolved (Intentionally):**

- Whether Kyr4n is attracted or just curious
- What "trying" would look like
- Timeline for anything physical
- How this changes their dynamic
- What happens next

The scene ends on connection and safety, not answers. Which is perfect for Kyr4n's character—he needs time to process, and Riley's giving him that time.
