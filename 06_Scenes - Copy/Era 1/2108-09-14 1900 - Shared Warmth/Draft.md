Kyr4n was still poking at a circuit board when Riley knocked. Didn't even look up when Isa yelled "Come in!" from her spot on the floor where she'd been updating inventory for the past hour.

 "You two look thrilling," Riley said, stepping inside and dropping his courier bag by the door. "Really living the dream here."

 "We're businesspeople now," Isa said, still not looking up from her tablet. "Businesspeople are boring."

 "Legitimate businesspeople," Kyr4n corrected.

 "Legitimate-*adjacent*," Isa and Riley said at the same time, then grinned at each other.

 Riley stretched, his jacket riding up enough to show a strip of skin above his belt. Kyr4n looked back at his circuit board very quickly. "Please tell me you're done for the day. I've been on the road for six hours and if I have to watch you work, I'm gonna fall asleep standing up."

 "He's been at it since noon," Isa reported, finally setting her tablet aside. "I made him eat around three, but that's it."

 "My hero." Riley nudged Kyr4n's shoulder as he passed. "Seriously though, you're gonna burn out your eyes."

 "It's fine."

 "It's not fine. Your posture is terrible." Riley flopped onto one of their salvaged chairs—the decent one with actual padding. "Isa, back me up here."
 
 "Your posture is terrible," she confirmed, standing and stretching. "Also you're hunched over like an old man."

 "I'm twenty," Kyr4n muttered, but he put down the soldering iron. Mostly because Riley was right about his eyes hurting.

 "Twenty going on sixty." Riley patted the cushion next to him. "Come sit before you fossilize."

 Kyr4n hesitated. The cushion was pretty small, and Riley took up space in that casual way he had, all loose limbs and easy comfort.

 "Don't make me come over there," Riley warned, but he was smiling.

 "You're annoying."

 "Yeah, but you like me anyway."

 Isa snorted. "He's got you there."

 Kyr4n crossed the small space and sat down, trying not to notice how their legs immediately pressed together. The cushion was definitely smaller than it looked.

 "There we go." Riley slouched back, apparently unconcerned about the contact. "See? Not dying."

 "Revolutionary," Isa said, echoing Riley's earlier comment. She grabbed her own cushion and dragged it over, settling on Kyr4n's other side. "Look at us. Sitting. Like normal people."

 "Is this what success looks like?" Riley asked. "Sitting down?"

 "Baby steps," Kyr4n said, and was rewarded with Isa's laugh—that high-pitched one she tried to hide because she thought it sounded weird. He liked it.

 They sat in comfortable quiet for a moment, the kind that only happened with people who didn't need to fill every silence. Riley's hand was resting on the cushion between them, close enough that Kyr4n could feel the warmth from it.

 "So how long you sticking around this time?" Isa asked.

 Riley shrugged. "Couple days maybe. Depends."

 "On what?"

 "Whether you've got beer. Work. The usual." He glanced at Kyr4n, something playful in his expression. "Good company."

 "We have beer," Isa said. "It's terrible beer, but it exists."

 "I can work with terrible." Riley shifted slightly, and suddenly his fingers were definitely touching Kyr4n's leg. Just resting there, casual, like it was normal. "What about work? Phoenix Recovery hiring?"

 "Always," Isa said. She reached over and squeezed Kyr4n's knee—another one of her casual touches that she'd been doing more lately. "We're expanding. Slowly. Need someone who can handle deliveries without asking too many questions."

 "My specialty." Riley's thumb moved slightly, tracing a small line on Kyr4n's thigh. "Though I gotta say, 'legitimate-adjacent' is doing some heavy lifting in that job description."

 "We prefer 'morally flexible,'" Kyr4n heard himself say.

 Both of them laughed, and the sound made something warm settle in his chest. Isa's hand was still on his knee, Riley's fingers still against his leg, and somehow having both of them this close wasn't as overwhelming as he'd expected. Just... warm.

 "You're tense," Isa observed.

 "I'm fine."

 "You're always fine," Riley said, not unkindly. "Doesn't mean you're not tense." His fingers pressed a bit more deliberately. "You know that breathing thing I taught you last time?"

 "The one you swore would help me sleep better?"

 "Did it work?"

 "...Sometimes."

 "High praise." Riley grinned. "Come here."

 "I'm already here."

 "Closer here." Riley tugged gently on his arm until Kyr4n shifted to face him a bit more. Their knees bumped. "Hand up."

 Kyr4n let Riley guide his palm to his chest, right over his heart. The steady beat of it pulsed under his skin, warm and alive.

 "Match that," Riley said simply. "Slow it down."

 Isa leaned against Kyr4n's shoulder, her breath soft against his neck. "We're not gonna let you work yourself to death," she murmured. "Someone's gotta keep you functional."

 "I'm functional."

 "You're a disaster," Riley said cheerfully. "But you're our disaster, so."

 His hand came up to rest on the back of Kyr4n's neck, thumb brushing the edge of his hairline. Isa's fingers laced through Kyr4n's free hand, and for a second everything was just... quiet. Good quiet. The kind with people in it.

 "This is nice," Riley said after a moment, his voice softer. He was looking at Isa over Kyr4n's shoulder, something unspoken passing between them. "Should do this more often."

 "You should stay more often," Isa countered.

 "Maybe I will." Riley's eyes came back to Kyr4n, that crooked smile back in place. "If the company's good."

 "The company's fine," Kyr4n said, but he didn't move away.

 "Yeah," Riley agreed, and his hand squeezed gently at Kyr4n's neck. "It really is."

They stayed like that while the light outside faded, three people who somehow fit together better than any of them had expected, learning that maybe being close to someone didn't have to hurt.
