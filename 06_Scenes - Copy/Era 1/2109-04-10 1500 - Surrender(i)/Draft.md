**FIRST TIME — Kyr4n's Silent POV**

---

Kyr4n sits on the edge of the sleeping mat, hands gripping his thighs. His analytical mind is running calculations it has no business running. Optimal angles. Potential discomfort thresholds. Muscle relaxation techniques. Lubrication viscosity—

"Hey."

Riley's voice. Soft. Grounding. He's standing in the doorway of the sleeping area, afternoon light behind him making his silhouette warm and golden.

"You're thinking too loud."

Kyr4n's laugh is shaky. "I know. I can't—I'm trying to stop but—"

"Come here."

Not a command. An invitation. Riley moves to the mat. Sits cross-legged. Pats the space in front of him.

Kyr4n shifts. Positions himself facing Riley. Their knees touching. Riley's hands find his immediately. Warm. Steady. Grounding.

"Breathe with me."

_Meditation. Of course. Ground me first._

Riley's breathing is slow. Deliberate. Four counts in. Hold. Four counts out. Kyr4n matches it. Fighting the urge to analyze the respiratory mechanics. Just—breathing.

One breath. Two. Three. His heartrate starts to slow. The racing thoughts quiet slightly.

"Better?"

Kyr4n nods. "A little. I'm still—nervous."

"Good."

That makes Kyr4n's eyes snap up. "Good?"

Riley's smile is soft. Understanding. "Means you care. Means it matters. If you weren't nervous, I'd be worried."

"I want this." The words tumble out. "I do. I just—I've never—"

"I know." Riley's thumb strokes the back of Kyr4n's hand. "We'll go slow. We'll stop if you need to. This is for you, not me."

"But you want—"

"I want you to feel good." Riley leans forward. Presses his forehead to Kyr4n's. "That's what I want. Everything else is just how we get there."

_Simple. He makes it sound so simple._

Kyr4n's breathing steadies. The knot in his chest loosens slightly. He can do this. He wants to do this. Riley will take care of him.

"Okay." Whisper. Determined. "Okay. I'm ready."

Riley kisses him. Soft. No urgency. Just—connection. His hands slide to Kyr4n's face. Cupping. Holding. Making Kyr4n the center of attention.

When they break apart, Riley's hands move to Kyr4n's shirt. "Can I?"

Kyr4n nods. Lifts his arms. The shirt comes off and cool air hits his skin. Riley's hands immediately follow—warming him, touching him, grounding him in physical sensation.

"Lie down. On your stomach first."

The instruction is gentle. No demand in it. But Kyr4n obeys. Lies face-down on the mat. His cheek against the pillow. Hands by his head. Trying to relax but his shoulders are tense.

Riley's hands settle on his back. Warm. Firm. And then—pressure. Massage. Working the knots out of his shoulders with practiced skill.

"_Mmm_—"

Small sound. Relief. Riley's hands know exactly where he holds tension. Exactly how much pressure to use. He works down Kyr4n's spine methodically. Not rushing. Just—soothing. Preparing.

"You hold everything here." Riley's hands work his lower back. "All that workshop tension. Let it go."

"Trying—"

"Don't try. Just feel."

_Just feel. Stop analyzing. Stop overthinking._

Riley's hands slide to Kyr4n's waistband. "Okay?"

"Yes."

The pants come down. Underwear with them. And Kyr4n is bare from the waist down. Exposed. Vulnerable. His ass in the air and Riley can see everything and—

"Beautiful."

The word stops Kyr4n's spiraling thoughts. "What?"

"You're beautiful. Every part of you." Riley's hands on his ass now. Not sexual. Just—touching. Appreciating. "Relax. I've got you."

The hands knead gently. Working the muscle. And Kyr4n tries to relax. Tries to let go of control. Tries to just—trust.

"Good. That's good." Riley's voice is warm. Approving. "Just like that."

Something cool touches his skin. Oil. Slick. Riley's hand spreading it. Not entering yet. Just—preparing. Making sure there's no friction. No pain.

"Tell me if anything doesn't feel good. Promise me."

"I promise."

"Good boy."

The words make Kyr4n's cock twitch. _Good boy._ Riley's never used that tone before. Approving. Possessive. And it does something to Kyr4n's brain. Makes him want to please. Want to be good for Riley.

One finger circles. Gentle pressure. Not pushing in yet. Just—touching. Letting him feel. Letting him anticipate.

"Breathe."

Kyr4n breathes. And on the exhale, Riley's finger slides in. Just the tip. Barely anything. But the sensation makes Kyr4n tense.

"_Ah_—"

"Easy. Breathe through it." Riley's other hand strokes his lower back. Soothing. "Just the first knuckle. You're doing so good."

_Tight. Pressure. Strange. Not bad. Just—different._

Riley doesn't move deeper. Just holds there. Letting Kyr4n adjust. Get used to the sensation. And slowly—slowly—Kyr4n's body relaxes around the intrusion.

"There you go. Good." Riley slides deeper. Second knuckle now. "Still okay?"

"Yes. It's—strange. But—okay."

"Gonna add more oil. Then we'll work you open properly."

More slick. More cool wetness. And Riley starts moving. Slow strokes. In and out. Not deep. Just—patient. Letting Kyr4n's body learn this. Accept this.

"_Nnh_—"

Small sound. The friction is strange. Intense. But not painful. Riley's finger finds something inside—pressure point that makes Kyr4n's breath catch.

"_Oh_—what—"

"Prostate." Riley's voice has warmth. Satisfaction. "Feel good?"

"_Yes_—"

"Gonna make you feel even better."

Riley works that spot. Gentle pressure. Circling. And pleasure sparks up Kyr4n's spine. Different from anything he's felt before. Deeper. More intense. His cock is hardening beneath him, pressing into the mat, and he can't stop the sounds escaping his throat.

"_Ah_—_Riley_—_fuck_—"

"That's it. Let me hear you."

Second finger. Gentle pressure. Sliding in alongside the first. The stretch makes Kyr4n tense.

"_Nnh_—wait—"

"Breathe. You've got this." Riley stills. Doesn't push deeper. Just holds. "Tell me when."

Kyr4n breathes. Forces his body to relax. The stretch burns slightly but it's not bad. Just—intense. After a moment, he nods.

"Okay. More."

Riley slides both fingers deeper. Scissoring gently. Opening him. Stretching. And the sensation is overwhelming. Too much. Not enough. He doesn't know what he needs.

"_God_—Riley—I can't—"

"You can. You're doing perfect." Riley's fingers work steadily. Patient. "Just breathe. Let your body adjust."

And it does. Slowly. The burn fades to pressure. The pressure fades to sensation. And Riley's fingers find that spot again—his prostate—and pleasure crashes through him.

"_Fuck_—_oh God_—_there_—"

"Found it." Satisfaction in Riley's voice. Pride. His fingers work that spot deliberately now. Rubbing. Pressing. And Kyr4n is making sounds he's never made before. High. Desperate. Needy.

"Riley—_please_—need—"

"What do you need?"

"_You_—need you—_inside_—please—"

Third finger. The stretch is more intense. Burns more. But Kyr4n breathes through it. Wants this. Needs this. Needs to feel Riley inside him completely.

Riley works all three fingers. Stretching. Preparing. Making sure Kyr4n can take him. And after what feels like forever—or seconds, Kyr4n can't tell anymore—Riley's fingers withdraw.

"_No_—don't—"

"Shh. Not leaving. Just—getting ready."

Kyr4n hears movement behind him. Clothes rustling. Then Riley's hands on his hips. Warm. Steadying.

"On your back. I want to see your face."

Kyr4n rolls over. His cock is hard. Leaking. Evidence of how much this affected him. Riley is bare now too. His cock hard and slick with oil. Ready.

Riley settles between Kyr4n's legs. Lifts them. Positions them over his shoulders. The angle makes Kyr4n feel exposed. Vulnerable. But Riley's eyes are warm. No judgment. Just—want.

"Look at me."

Kyr4n meets his eyes. Holds them. Riley's hand wraps around his own cock. Slicking it more. Making sure there's no friction. Then—pressure. The head of Riley's cock pressing against him.

"Breathe. Push out like you're—just breathe."

Kyr4n breathes. Bears down slightly. And Riley pushes in.

"_Ah_—_fuck_—_oh God_—"

The stretch is intense. So much more than fingers. Burns. Overwhelms. Too much—

"Breathe. I've got you. Just the head. Just—breathe."

Riley stills. Not moving deeper. Just holding there. Letting Kyr4n adjust. And Kyr4n breathes. Forces his body to relax. To accept. To open.

"Good. So good. You're taking me so well."

The praise helps. Kyr4n focuses on Riley's voice. His eyes. The warmth in them. The patience. And slowly—slowly—his body relaxes.

"More?"

"_Yes_—please—more—"

Riley slides deeper. Inch by inch. Slow. Careful. And the stretch is overwhelming but not painful. Just—full. So full. More than he thought possible.

"_Nnh_—_God_—Riley—so—_full_—"

"Halfway. You're doing perfect."

_Halfway. Only halfway and I'm already—_

Riley keeps pushing. Slow. Steady. And Kyr4n can't think anymore. Can only feel. The stretch. The burn. The fullness. The way Riley's cock is pressing against his prostate with every inch. Making pleasure spark despite the intensity.

"_Oh_—_fuck_—_can't_—_too much_—"

"You can. Almost there." Riley's hand finds Kyr4n's cock. Strokes. Gentle. Grounding. "Just a little more."

And then—_full_. Completely. Riley's hips flush against his ass. Completely buried inside him. And Kyr4n can't breathe. Can't think. Can only feel Riley everywhere. Filling him. Claiming him. Owning him.

"_Fuck_—_oh God_—Riley—_you're_—_so deep_—"

"Yeah." Riley's voice is strained. Rough. "So tight. So perfect. _Fuck_—Kyr4n—"

Riley stills. Both of them breathing hard. Adjusting. Kyr4n to being filled. Riley to being gripped so tight.

"Need—need a second—" Riley's eyes close. "Feel too good. Gonna—need to—"

_He's struggling too. Trying not to come already. Because I feel that good._

The knowledge sends arousal spiking through Kyr4n. He did that. He's making Riley struggle for control.

After a moment, Riley opens his eyes. "Okay. Gonna move. Tell me if—"

"_Yes_—please—_move_—"

Riley pulls back. Slow. The drag makes Kyr4n gasp. Then pushes back in. Still slow. Testing. Finding the angle.

"_Ah_—_there_—_oh fuck_—_there_—"

Riley's cock hits his prostate dead-on. Pleasure explodes through him. His back arches. His hands fly to Riley's arms. Gripping. Needing anchor.

"Found it." Riley's smile is satisfied. Feral. "Gonna make you come just from this. Just from my cock inside you."

"_Yes_—_please_—_God yes_—"

Riley sets a rhythm. Slow. Deep. Angling to hit Kyr4n's prostate every thrust. And Kyr4n is falling apart. Making sounds he's never made. High. Desperate. Begging.

"_Fuck_—_Riley_—_please_—_more_—_harder_—"

"Yeah? Want it harder?"

"_Yes_—_please_—need—_God_—"

Riley speeds up. Thrusts harder. Still careful but more demanding. Taking what he needs while giving Kyr4n what he needs. And the room fills with sounds. Skin slapping. Kyr4n's moans. Riley's harsh breathing. The slick sounds of fucking.

"_So good_—_taking me so good_—_knew you would_—_fuck_—"

Riley's hand wraps around Kyr4n's cock. Stroking in time with his thrusts. Dual sensation. Too much. Overwhelming. Kyr4n's brain shorts out. No analysis. No calculation. Just—sensation. Pleasure. Riley inside him. Around him. Everywhere.

"_Close_—_I'm_—_Riley_—_fuck_—_gonna_—"

"Come for me. Let me feel you."

Permission. Command. And Kyr4n obeys. Comes with a shout. Clenching around Riley's cock. Spilling over Riley's hand. His whole body seizing. Pleasure whiting out everything else.

And the sensation of Kyr4n clenching—_tight, pulsing, gripping_—triggers Riley.

"_Fuck_—Kyr4n—_oh God_—"

Riley thrusts once more. Twice. Then buries himself completely. Coming deep inside. His cock pulsing. Filling Kyr4n with heat. Marking him from the inside.

They stay frozen. Both shaking. Both breathing hard. Riley buried completely. Kyr4n's legs still over his shoulders. Connected. Complete.

"_Oh God_—" Kyr4n's voice is wrecked. Broken. "_That was_—_I can't_—"

"Yeah." Riley's laugh is breathless. Awed. "Yeah."

When Riley finally pulls out—slow, gentle—Kyr4n whimpers at the loss. The emptiness. He can feel Riley's come starting to leak from him. Physical proof of ownership. Of claim.

Riley lowers Kyr4n's legs carefully. Mindful of soreness. Then collapses beside him. Both of them boneless. Spent.

"You okay?"

The question is soft. Concerned. Riley's hand finding Kyr4n's face. Checking. Making sure.

"I'm—" Kyr4n can't find words. "That was—God. Riley. I—"

"Good different?"

Kyr4n laughs. Shaky. "Yeah. Really good different."

Riley shifts. Gathers Kyr4n against his chest. Kyr4n goes willingly. His ass is sore. His body is wrung out. But he feels—_complete_. Satisfied in a way he's never felt before.

"Thank you." Whisper against Riley's chest. "For—for being patient. For making it—"

"Perfect?" Riley's hand strokes his hair. "Because it was. You were perfect."

"I was terrified."

"I know. But you trusted me anyway." Riley presses a kiss to his forehead. "That's—that means everything."

They lie quiet. Breathing syncing. Hearts slowing. The afternoon light shifts through the window. Warm. Golden. Safe.

"Isa's gonna be jealous," Kyr4n murmurs. "That she missed this."

Riley's chest rumbles with laughter. "She'll make us tell her every detail. You know she will."

"_Mmm_—probably make us do it again while she watches."

"Would you?"

Kyr4n considers. The vulnerability. The exposure. But—with both of them? With Isa watching Riley take him?

"Yeah. I would."

"Good." Riley's hand slides down. Cups Kyr4n's ass. Possessive. Gentle. "Because I'm definitely doing this again. You feel too good."

"Sore."

"I'll be gentle. Next time."

"Next time." The words settle warm in Kyr4n's chest. Promise. Future. This isn't a one-time thing. This is theirs now. Part of what they are together.

Sleep pulls at him. Exhaustion and satisfaction mixing. But he fights it for a moment. Wanting to memorize this. Riley's heartbeat under his ear. The warmth. The safety. The feeling of being claimed. Owned. Loved.

"Riley?"

"Mmm?"

"I love you."

The words surprise him. He's never said them to Riley before. Has thought them. But never voiced them. Too vulnerable. Too exposed.

But after what they just did—after Riley took him apart so completely—the words feel right. True. Necessary.

Riley's arms tighten. "Love you too. So much."

Simple. No elaborate response. Just—truth. And it's enough.

Kyr4n lets his eyes close. Lets sleep take him. Safe in Riley's arms. Marked by Riley. Claimed by Riley.

His analytical mind is quiet for once. No calculations. No overthinking. Just—peace.

_I can surrender. I can let go. And I'm still safe. Still loved. Still me._

The realization settles deep. Changes something fundamental. He doesn't have to control everything. Doesn't have to analyze everything. Sometimes he can just—feel. Trust. Surrender.

And be loved for it.

Outside, Phoenix Recovery hums. Inside, two men sleep. Connected. Complete. Building something that will matter. Something that will last.

Until it doesn't.

Until July brings betrayal and virus and transformation.

But for now—for this moment—they have each other. Have this connection. Have this love.

And it's enough.
