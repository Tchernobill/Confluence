The courier bag hits Riley's floor softer this time—Isa's already reaching for him before it settles.

"Hey," Riley says, catching her hands gently. Not pulling away, just... not matching her momentum. "You okay?"

"Fine." She closes the distance, rises on her toes to kiss him. He returns it, but there's something measured in his response. Something that wasn't there three weeks ago, that night when everything felt easy and right and uncomplicated.

Everything is supposed to be fine now. They talked. Kyr4n said he understood. Said he knew their relationship didn't have rigid rules, that he wasn't going to make this into something it didn't need to be. His voice had been calm, logical, exactly what Kyr4n's voice always sounds like when he's processing something painful through that brilliant, analytical mind.

Fine. Everything is fine.

So why does Riley still feel like he's waiting for something?

"Where's Kyr4n tonight?" Riley asks, stepping back slightly, giving her space when she wants the opposite.

"Working late. Some complex repair." Isa slides her hands up Riley's chest, feels his heartbeat steady under her palms. "He said we should... you know. Enjoy ourselves. Not worry about him."

Riley's jaw tightens almost imperceptibly. "Did he say that, or did he say it's okay?"

"What's the difference?"

"Isa—"

"He's fine, Riley." She hears the edge in her own voice, smooths it out. "We talked. Remember? You were there. He said he understood."

"Understanding and being okay aren't always the same thing."

Something cold twists in her chest. "Are you saying you don't want—"

"I didn't say that." Riley cups her face gently, thumbs brushing her cheekbones. The gesture is tender but there's a distance in his eyes that wasn't there before. "I'm just checking in. On you. On him. On all of this."

"I'm here because I want to be." The words come out more defensive than she intends. "With you. Is that not okay anymore?"

"It's okay." But he doesn't sound certain. He sounds careful.

Isa kisses him again, harder this time, trying to bridge whatever gap has opened between that first night and now. Riley responds—of course he does, Riley is generous and warm and present—but she can feel him thinking. Feel him somewhere else even while his lips move against hers, his hands settling on her waist.

She's being selfish. She knows she is. Came here tonight because Kyr4n has been so *careful* around her lately, so polite and distant and "of course I understand." Because she needs to feel wanted in a way that doesn't come with weight, with careful consideration, with that analytical processing that makes her feel like she's a problem to be solved.

Riley makes her feel beautiful without thinking about it. Without processing. Just responds to her like it's easy.

Except tonight it's not easy.

"Do you want me?" Isa hears herself ask, and hates how small her voice sounds.

"Isa—" Riley's expression softens into something like pain. "Of course I do."

"Then show me."

It's not fair. She knows it's not fair. Using his kindness, his desire to make people happy, his goddamn *care* for her as leverage. But she needs this. Needs to feel something other than the careful distance Kyr4n has been maintaining, the way he works late more often now, the way he touches her like she's delicate when they finally do share space.

Riley studies her face for a long moment. She can see him weighing something—his concern for Kyr4n against his desire for her, maybe. His knowledge that something isn't resolved against his impulse to avoid making waves.

Then he kisses her, slow and thorough, and walks them backward toward the sleeping mat.

"Okay," he murmurs against her mouth. "Yeah. Okay."

They undress each other with less laughter than last time. More urgency from her, more consideration from him. When Riley lays her down, his touch is gentle, attentive—reading her body like he did before, learning what makes her gasp, what makes her arch into him.

But there's something different in the way he watches her. Like he's trying to figure out what she needs beyond the physical. Like he's worried.

She doesn't want him worried. She wants him present, wants him lost in this the way she is, wants to not think about Kyr4n's careful politeness or the way her chest goes tight when she catches him watching her and Riley together with that unreadable expression.

"Riley," she whispers, pulling him closer. "Don't think. Just—"

"I'm here." He kisses her throat, her collarbone, works his way down her body with that meditative attention. "I've got you."

He does have her. His mouth, his hands, the steady presence of him focusing entirely on her pleasure. She closes her eyes and lets herself fall into the sensation—the building heat, the tightening coil, the blessed distraction from her own spiraling thoughts.

When she comes apart, it's with Riley's name on her lips and her hands fisted in his hair. He gentles her through it, then moves up her body to kiss her softly.

"You're beautiful," he says, because he always knows what she needs to hear. "So beautiful."

She pulls him into her, wraps her legs around his waist. Riley enters her carefully, watching her face, adjusting to her responses. He moves like he does everything—present, unhurried, paying attention. Building her toward another peak with steady rhythm.

But when she opens her eyes, meets his gaze, she sees it. The shadow of concern. The part of him that's here with her and the part that's somewhere else. With Kyr4n, probably. Wondering if their friend is actually okay or just saying he is.

She comes again, harder this time, pulling Riley with her. He shudders, face buried in her neck, breath hot against her skin. They stay connected for a moment, just breathing.

Then Riley carefully withdraws, reaches for his shirt to clean them both. The gesture is familiar but feels more distant than it did before. More automatic.

Isa pulls the thin blanket over them, settles against Riley's side. He wraps an arm around her, fingers tracing absent patterns on her shoulder. Comfortable. Safe.

Hollow.

"That was..." she starts, then realizes she doesn't know how to finish.

"Yeah," Riley agrees quietly.

They lie in silence. The golden light from the window makes everything look warmer than it feels. Isa should feel satisfied—she got what she came for, didn't she? Physical release, validation, Riley's steady presence and generous attention.

So why does her chest still feel tight?

"Is Kyr4n really okay?" The question comes out before she can stop it.

Riley's fingers pause on her shoulder. "I don't know. He says he is."

"But you don't believe him."

"I think..." Riley chooses his words carefully. "I think he's trying very hard to be okay. To not be the problem. To give us what we want."

"That's what we all agreed on." Even to her own ears, it sounds defensive. "He said he understood. That we weren't exclusive, that this was allowed—"

"Allowed isn't the same as easy." Riley's voice is gentle but firm. "And understanding something intellectually doesn't mean it doesn't hurt."

Isa's throat tightens. "So what, I'm just supposed to... what? Not want you? Pretend I don't?"

"I'm not saying that." Riley pulls her closer, kisses the top of her head. "I'm just saying maybe we need to check in more. Actually check in, not just ask if things are okay and accept 'fine' as an answer."

"You sound like you regret this."

"No." He tilts her face up to meet his eyes. "I don't regret being with you. But I am worried about him. About all of us."

Isa wants to argue. Wants to say they did everything right—they talked, they were honest, Kyr4n *said* he understood. But something in Riley's steady gaze makes her pause.

She thinks about Kyr4n working late. Again. How he's been doing that more often since they talked. How he smiles at her and Riley but it doesn't quite reach his eyes anymore. How he touches her like she's fragile, like he's afraid she'll break.

Or leave.

The guilt that's been sitting at the base of her spine spreads through her chest.

"I didn't mean to hurt him," she whispers.

"I know." Riley's voice is impossibly gentle. "But impact matters more than intent."

"I'm a terrible person."

"You're a person who made a choice without thinking through all the consequences." His fingers card through her hair, soothing. "You're nineteen and figuring things out. That doesn't make you terrible. Just... young. Learning."

"He hates me now."

"He doesn't hate you. I don't think Kyr4n knows how to hate you." Riley's expression turns sad. "I think he's scared. That he's not enough. That he's the problem. That we're going to figure out we don't need him."

The words hit like a physical blow. Because that's exactly how Kyr4n would process this, isn't it? Not "Isa hurt me," but "I'm insufficient." Not "this situation is painful," but "I'm the impediment."

"Fuck," Isa breathes.

"Yeah."

"What do I do?"

Riley is quiet for a moment. "I think you talk to him. Really talk. Not just accept his 'I'm fine.' Ask him how he *feels*, not just what he thinks."

"He doesn't do feelings."

"He does. He just does them quietly. Internally. Like he's not allowed to take up space with them."

Isa closes her eyes, presses her face against Riley's chest. His heartbeat is steady under her ear. Reliable. But reliability isn't enough, is it? Being wanted isn't enough if you're hurting the people who want you.

"I came here tonight because I needed to feel good," she admits quietly. "About myself. About being wanted. I wasn't thinking about him."

"I know."

"You still..."

"I didn't want you to feel worse." Riley's voice is honest, matter-of-fact. "And I wanted you. Those things were both true. But I was also worried the whole time. About him. About whether we're actually okay or just saying we are."

"I'm sorry."

"Don't apologize to me. I made my choice too." He kisses her forehead. "But maybe we both need to think about what we're doing. Why we're doing it. Whether 'everyone said it's okay' is good enough."

Isa nods against his chest, throat too tight for words.

They lie in silence as the golden light fades to blue evening. Somewhere across South Shore, Kyr4n is working late. Fixing something broken with careful, precise hands. Not taking up space with his hurt because he learned a long time ago that his pain makes him a burden.

And she came here seeking validation while he slowly convinced himself he was the problem.

The physical satisfaction feels very far away now. Replaced by something heavy and complicated and requiring actual work instead of just words.

"I should go talk to him," Isa says finally.

"Probably." Riley doesn't let go yet. "But Isa? When you do... actually listen. Don't just apologize and then do the same thing again."

She pulls back to look at him. "Is that what I do?"

His expression is gentle but honest. "Sometimes, yeah. You apologize beautifully. But then you center your fear of losing people over their actual feelings. 'Don't do that to me' instead of 'I hurt you.'"

The words sting because they're true.

"I'll work on that," she whispers.

"Good." Riley pulls her back against him. "Stay a bit longer. Then go. Actually talk. Figure out what all three of us need, not just what we want in the moment."

"And us? You and me?"

"That depends on what happens with him. With all of us." Riley's voice is steady but serious. "I care about you, Isa. But I care about him too. And I'm not going to keep being the easy option while he quietly breaks."

The words should feel like rejection but they don't. They feel like finally, someone saying the true thing instead of the comfortable thing.

"Okay," Isa says softly. "Okay."

They stay tangled together as night falls. The hollow satisfaction settles into something heavier—recognition that feeling good for a moment isn't the same as actually being okay.

That sometimes the kindest thing isn't giving people what they want. It's being honest about what's really happening.

When Isa finally leaves Riley's apartment, the night air is cool against her flushed skin. She heads toward Phoenix Recovery, toward Kyr4n working late because that's easier than being home with his careful politeness and quiet hurt.

Toward the conversation that should have happened three weeks ago, before she decided "he said it's okay" was good enough.

Her chest is tight. Not with need now. With the uncomfortable recognition that she's been selfish. That she hurt someone who matters. That saying sorry isn't enough if you don't change the behavior.

The physical pleasure has faded completely. What's left is harder. More complicated.

More real.

**Scene Notes:**

- **Emotional core:** Hollow validation-seeking, concern vs. accommodation, absence as loud presence
- **Character consistency:** Isa's impulsive selfishness showing, Riley's gentle conflict avoidance, Kyr4n's quiet suffering through absence
- **Relationship dynamics:** Surface functioning over genuine health, physical connection masking emotional problems
- **Intimacy approach:** Physical satisfaction undermined by emotional hollowness; different from first encounter
- **POV focus:** Isa's rationalizations slowly crumbling as she confronts her own behavior
- **Thematic resonance:** Impact over intent, Band-Aid vs. stitches, difference between allowed and okay
- **Continuity:** Shows damage from previous hurt not actually healed, sets up need for deeper work
