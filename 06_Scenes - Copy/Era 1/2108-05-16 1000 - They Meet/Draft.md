The woman appears at the edge of Kyr4n's peripheral vision the way most customers do—hesitant, assessing whether he's available. He doesn't look up from the neural interface splayed across his workbench, its synaptic pathways exposed like delicate copper veins. The soldering iron hums in his grip. Heated flux smells like burnt honey and regret.

She doesn't move closer. Just stands there, three meters back, watching.

Most people clear their throat, shuffle their feet, perform some small ritual of requesting attention. She does none of these things. Simply waits, patient and deliberate, as if she already knows he'll notice her eventually.

He does. Has to.

Kyr4n finishes the bridge connection—point-three millimeters of silver solder holding two pathways that shouldn't be compatible—and sets down the iron. Only then does he glance up.

Mid-twenties, maybe. Dark hair with red highlights catching the harsh LED work lights. Hazel eyes with gold flecks that pick up the glow from his bench. She's dressed like most of the underground dealers—practical jacket with too many pockets, worn boots that have seen real miles. But there's something in the way she holds herself. Like she's used to being watched and has decided not to care.

Recognition flickers. Yesterday, during the afternoon lull, someone lingering by Third Stack. Same red highlights. Same deliberate stillness.

"You were watching yesterday," he says.

Her smile is quick, easy. "Wasn't me. Lots of people have red hair in the Slum."

The deflection is smooth enough to be genuine, practiced enough to be a lie. He lets it drop. People have their reasons for denying things.

"You're Kyr4n?" she asks. "The Artisan?"

"I'm Kyr4n. Never heard of an artisan."

"That's what people call you at the market. The one who fixes things properly." She steps forward, casual, but her eyes never leave his face. "Do you deal in implant repairs? Device assessments?"

"I do repairs. Assessments too, if that's what you need."

"Good." She pulls a compact device from one of those pockets. Neuro-muscular stimulator, second-hand by the wear pattern on the casing. She sets it on his bench with care—not the carelessness of someone who doesn't know what they're carrying, but the precision of someone who knows exactly what it's worth. "Want to know if this is worth what I paid for it."

"Twenty credits for an assessment."

She extends her wrist without hesitation, taps his payment terminal. The transaction chimes.

"Thank you," he says.

He picks up the stimulator, turns it over in his hands. Pamko manufacturer, street-grade but solid construction. The weight distribution is good—whoever built this knew what they were doing, even with limited materials.

"Pamko," he says, more to himself than her. "Good quality build. Street-grade but legitimate components."

Instead of handing it back, he reaches for his diagnostic rig. She's paying for thorough—might as well mean it. He connects the device, initiates the performance analysis sequence. The machine begins its work, subsystems lighting up across his display. Four minutes, maybe five.

"You don't have to—" she starts.

"You paid for thorough."

She settles against the edge of his workbench, comfortable in his space in a way most people aren't. The silence stretches for maybe ten seconds. Then: "So how long you been working this corner?"

"Few weeks."

"Reputation's already building." Her tone is conversational, but he can feel her assessing him, the way he assesses damaged circuits. "People say you actually fix things instead of just making them work long enough to take the money."

He glances at her. "There's a difference?"

"Most people don't think so. Most people in the Slum are just trying to survive until tomorrow." She picks up a small component from his bench—a damaged capacitor he'd set aside earlier—turns it over in her fingers. "You've got systems. Labels. Organization. Like you're planning to still be here next year."

"Things work better when they're organized."

"People work better when they're connected." She sets the capacitor back exactly where she found it, watching to see if he notices. He does. "But you've got this whole operation set up for one. No assistant. No partner. Just you and your tools."

The observation is sharper than it should be. More perceptive. He doesn't like being read this easily.

"Easier that way," he says.

"Easier. Not better."

"Same thing."

"No." Her voice is certain, gentle. "It's really not."

The diagnostic rig hums between them. She lets the silence sit for a moment, then changes direction. "You from the Stacks?"

"Underground."

"Literally?" Her eyebrows rise. "Like, actually underground, or just lower levels?"

"Utility shaft. Forty meters down."

She studies him with new interest. "That's... committed to solitude."

"It's quiet."

"It's isolated." She tilts her head. "You know there's a difference between being alone and being lonely, right?"

The question lands too close to something he doesn't examine. He focuses on the diagnostic screen instead. "Two minutes left."

She accepts the deflection, but something in her expression says she's filed that reaction away for later analysis. "You learn this somewhere? This level of work doesn't come from trial and error."

"I have a thing for how things work."

"Things." She picks up another component—a circuit board fragment—examines it. "Not people."

"Things don't lie."

"People only lie when they're trying to protect something." She sets the fragment down. "What are you protecting, Kyr4n?"

The question is too direct, too personal. But she asks it like she's inquiring about his supplier, not his psychology. Casual. Curious.

"My work," he says finally. "I protect my work."

"By keeping it separate from everything else." She nods slowly, like he's confirmed something she already suspected. "That's why you live in a hole in the ground. Why you don't have a comm unit. Why you're precise about everything except people."

"You've known me for five minutes."

"I've been watching you for two days." She says it without apology. "And I'm good at reading people. You're good at reading things. We all have our craft."

The diagnostic rig beeps. He turns to it gratefully, pulls up the report. Performance metrics, component integrity, market value. Everything his hands already told him, but in quantified form.

He unplugs the stimulator, hands it back with the printed report. "Street-grade implant, but good quality. All systems performing within normal parameters. Worth between four hundred and four-fifty credits, depending on buyer."

She scans the report, eyebrows rising. "I paid two-fifty."

"Then you got a good deal."

"Or the seller didn't know what they had." She folds the report carefully, tucks it away. "You could've told me it was worth less. I wouldn't have known the difference."

A shy smile tugs at the corner of his mouth. "Dishonest assessments are five credits. You paid twenty."

She blinks. Then laughs—genuinely delighted, the sound warm and surprised. "Okay. That's the first time you've looked like an actual person and not a very polite machine."

The observation should sting, but her tone is too warm, too approving. Like she's glad to discover he's human underneath the precision.

"Thank you," he says, uncertain whether it's a compliment.

"I deal in implants," she says. "Underground distribution, specialty tech. I'm always looking for reliable assessment work." She pauses, then adds, "And I think you're going to be very useful."

"Useful." The word sits strangely in his mouth. "Like a tool."

"Like someone who does what they say they'll do." Her voice softens. "That's rare in the Slum. Most people here are just trying not to drown. You're trying to build something. Even if you're building it alone."

The distinction feels important, though he's not sure why.

"You can find me here," he says. "Most days."

"No comm unit?"

"No."

"That's going to make business complicated."

"Then maybe business isn't what I'm built for."

"Maybe." She pushes off from his workbench, shoulders her bag. Something shifts in her expression—a decision made. "I'm Isa, by the way. Isa Mercer."

"Kyr4n. Thank you for the work."

"Just Kyr4n?"

"Just Kyr4n."

She nods, accepts it. Then, quieter: "You know what the difference is between broken things and broken people, Kyr4n?"

He waits.

"Broken things want to be fixed. Broken people just want to be understood." She studies him for a long moment. "I think you're very good at fixing things."

The implication hangs there: *But what about people?*

"I like you," she says before he can respond. "I'll definitely be thinking of you... when I have more jobs."

The pause is deliberate. Ambiguous. Like the thinking might be about more than just business, and she's comfortable letting him know that.

"Bye, Kyr4n."

He raises his hand in a small wave.

She walks away into the market crowd, red highlights catching the late-afternoon light. He watches her go longer than he should, tracking her movement until she disappears past Third Stack.

The market noise filters back in. His workbench is exactly as he left it—organized, systematic, built for efficiency and isolation. But something in the space feels different now. Like she's left a question behind, sitting in the air where her voice was.

*Broken things want to be fixed. Broken people just want to be understood.*

He picks up his soldering iron, reaches for the next repair. Standard work. Nothing challenging.

But his hands hesitate over the components, and he realizes what's bothering him.

She watched him for two days before approaching. Spent those two days deciding whether he was worth the risk of connection. And then she came anyway, armed with a simple assessment job and too many perceptive questions.

*What are you protecting?*

His work, he'd said. But that wasn't quite true, was it?

He was protecting the thing his work let him avoid: the mess and complication of people who lie, who leave, who disappoint. The unbearable vulnerability of being understood.

She saw that. In five minutes, she saw what he'd spent two years hiding in forty meters of concrete and careful isolation.

And instead of walking away, she left him her name and a promise to return.

*I like you.*

Not: I like your work. Not: You're useful. Just: *I like you.*

Like she'd already decided the difference mattered.

He returns to his repairs, but part of his attention stays on the crowd, watching for red highlights that won't return today. Maybe won't return at all—he gave her nothing but precision and deflection, after all. Nothing worth coming back for.

Except.

*The first time you've looked like an actual person and not a very polite machine.*

She'd been pleased by that. Pleased to discover the human underneath the system. Like she was looking for that human all along, and the joke about dishonest assessments was confirmation that he existed.

The thought sits in his chest, unfamiliar and dangerous.

She'll come back. For business, certainly. But maybe—

No.

He cuts the thought off before it can finish forming. Safer that way. Cleaner.

But deep beneath his practiced isolation, in a place he doesn't examine too closely, a question keeps circling.

*When will she come back?*

And quieter, more dangerous:

*What if she already knows what I'm protecting, and doesn't care?*

**Word count:** ~2,000

**ELEVATED ELEMENTS:**

**Tension without conflict:**
- Her watching him vs. his awareness of being watched
- Her perceptiveness vs. his guardedness  
- The diagnostic rig creating enforced proximity
- Her reading him while he tries to deflect
- The dance of assessment (she assesses him, he assesses device)

**Character contrast:**
- "Things work better when they're organized" vs. "People work better when they're connected"
- "Things don't lie" vs. "People only lie when they're trying to protect something"  
- His isolation vs. her connection-seeking
- His precision with objects vs. her precision with people

**Dialogue doing double duty:**
- Business talk about assessment = philosophical talk about trust
- "Useful like a tool" / "Like someone who does what they say they'll do" = reliability vs. humanity
- Device assessment = character assessment
- Talk about broken implants = talk about broken people

**Memorable/quotable lines:**
- "Dishonest assessments are five credits. You paid twenty."
- "There's a difference between being alone and being lonely, right?"
- "Things don't lie." / "People only lie when they're trying to protect something."
- "Broken things want to be fixed. Broken people just want to be understood."
- "You're trying to build something. Even if you're building it alone."
- "The first time you've looked like an actual person and not a very polite machine."
