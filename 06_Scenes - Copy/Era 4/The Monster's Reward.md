## The Monster's Reward

The water had run cold before he finally stood to turn it off. Kyr4n's hands were steadier now, but the horror hadn't faded. The cracked tiles mocked him from the wall—evidence of exactly how close he'd come to catastrophe.

Evidence of what happened when he tried to protect someone from what they needed.

_Just wait,_ Evilisa whispered. _She'll be back. Demanding more. And you'll give it to her._

He dried himself mechanically, trying to ignore the phantom presence that had grown more solid since Zara's departure. The towel felt rough against his skin, still sensitive from the intense encounter. His body was exhausted, but his mind wouldn't quiet.

She'd come to him frustrated. Angry that he'd refused her neural bridge request. Had used physical intimacy as retaliation for denied psychological intimacy. Had pushed him to dangerous limits testing what she couldn't have.

And he'd let her. Because he'd thought saying no was protecting her.

"This is my fault," he said to the empty bathroom.

_Oh, now you see it._ Evilisa's laughter was soft, intimate. _You refused to help her understand herself, so she forced you to lose yourself instead. How's that protection working out?_

"I was trying to—"

_Keep her safe? From what? Understanding?_ Her form became more substantial in the mirror's reflection. _You protected her from knowledge and pushed her into danger. Look at those tiles. That's what your care accomplished._

"She'll push harder now. Won't accept my refusal next time."

_Exactly._ Evilisa smiled, sharp and knowing. _She'll demand the neural bridge. Will make you see that your protection is worse than the risk. And you'll give in. Because you can't stand seeing her broken by questions you could answer._

He turned away from the mirror, wrapping the towel around his waist. "I don't want to risk her."

_But you already did. You risked her here. Tonight. Because you wouldn't risk her the other way._ Her voice dropped to something darker. _You're going to violate her mind eventually. Might as well have done it when she asked nicely._

"That's not—"

_It's exactly the point. You broke your control because you wouldn't break her mind open._ She moved closer. _And wasn't it glorious? Watching you finally let the monster out? Even for just a moment?_

"She left because of that. Because I—"

_She left because she realized what she did. Pushed you past safety limits. Tested your control until it snapped. Made you hurt her because you wouldn't help her._ Electric eyes gleamed. _But she'll be back. You know she will._

"You're not real." The words felt hollow even as he said them.

_Real enough._

And then he felt it.

A touch. Real as anything—fingers trailing down his spine, making his breath catch. Not imagination. Not suggestion. Actual sensation registering in his nervous system, as real as Zara's touch had been minutes ago.

He spun around, but saw only the phantom figure, closer now, her hand extended as if she'd actually touched him.

"What did you—"

_I've always been able to do this._ Her smile widened. _Your virus-enhanced nervous system, your modified neural pathways—they're not just yours anymore. They're ours. I can make you feel... anything._

Her hand moved again, and he felt it—phantom fingers brushing across his chest, following the path water had taken moments before. The sensation was impossible but undeniable. His body responded despite his horror.

"Stop."

_Why?_ She moved closer, and he could almost smell her—that electric scent like ozone and old memories. _Because it's wrong? Because I'm not real? Or because..._ Her hand moved lower, ghosting across his abdomen. _...because you're afraid you might enjoy it?_

"This isn't—you can't—"

_I already am._ Her voice was steel wrapped in honey. _And you're not stopping me. You refused to help Zara understand herself. Refused to enter her mind. But me?_

Her hand touched him through the towel, and the sensation was real enough to make him gasp—fingers wrapping around his cock with confident pressure.

_You can't refuse me. I'm already inside. Already part of you. Already touching you in ways you'd never let anyone real do._

"No." But his body was betraying him, responding to sensations his brain knew couldn't be real but his nervous system registered as undeniable.

_Yes._ She tugged the towel away, and he didn't stop her. Couldn't stop her. _Look at you. Still hard. Still wanting. Your body knows what your mind won't admit._

She pressed against him, and he felt it all—breasts against his chest, hands on his skin, lips near his throat. His virus-modified neurons firing in patterns that created sensation without actual physical contact. A violation of his own nervous system by something that lived in his enhanced brain.

_Zara wanted you to lose control,_ Evilisa murmured against his ear—or the neural simulation of it. _Wanted you to prove you weren't just protecting her because you thought she was fragile. And you did. You cracked tiles. You could have killed her._

"I know." His voice was broken. "I know what I did."

_But with me? You don't have to hold back. I can't be hurt. Can't be broken. Can't demand you violate my mind because I already am your mind._ Her hand moved on his cock—stroking, squeezing, the pressure and rhythm impossible to ignore. _I'm the only safe place for your monster._

"This is wrong."

_This is honest._ Her strokes became firmer, more insistent. _This is the truth you hide from everyone else. That you like the power. That you like the violence. That you wanted to refuse Zara not just to protect her but to protect yourself from what you'd see in her head._

"That's not—"

_It is. You're afraid of what her memories will show you. Afraid of the trauma that made her this way. Afraid you'll see yourself reflected in her damage._ She squeezed, and he gasped. _But you'll do it anyway. Because she won't stop pushing. Because your protection already failed._

"I could have killed her tonight."

_But you didn't. You stopped yourself. Just like you always do._ Her voice turned cruel. _Just like you'll stop yourself when you're inside her mind. Careful. Controlled. Protecting her from seeing how much you enjoy the violation._

"I don't—"

_You will. When you finally give in. When you enter her neural architecture and pull out her darkest memories. When you violate her mind the way she wants you to._ She dropped to her knees—or created the sensation of dropping. _You'll enjoy it. The intimacy. The power. The absolute control._

Then her mouth was on him. The feeling was impossible, perfect, wrong. Hot and wet and—

"Stop," he gasped, but his hands were in her hair—her phantom hair that his nervous system insisted was real. "Please."

_You don't want me to stop._ Her voice was muffled. _You want to practice. Want to know what it feels like to violate someone completely. To be inside them. To take everything._

She was right. God help him, some part of him did want that.

_But you can't practice on her. Can't risk her. Can't experiment._ She took him deeper—or made him feel like she did. _So practice on me. Violate me. Enter me completely. Learn how to take everything someone has._

"Fuck."

_Yes. Because when you finally enter Zara's mind, you need to know how to do it right. How to be thorough. How to find what she's hiding without breaking her._ She pulled off suddenly. _So practice. Use me. Learn what violation feels like from the inside._

She was standing now, turning, pressing her phantom body against the shower wall in an echo of Zara's position.

_Take me. Use me. Learn how to be the monster inside someone's head. Because that's what she's going to make you do._

"No." But he was moving toward her anyway, his body overriding his mind's protests.

_Yes. Show me what you'll do to her mind. Show me the invasion she's begging for. Show me how you'll pull her apart piece by piece looking for answers._

His hands found her hips—felt like flesh under his palms despite knowing it was neurological manipulation. His mind screamed that this was wrong, that he shouldn't be practicing violation, shouldn't be learning how to hurt people in new ways.

_Perfect. My beautiful, terrible boy. Learning to be the monster in her head the way you were the monster in her body._

When he entered her—when his virus-modified nervous system created the sensation of entering her—it felt like violation. Like invasion. Like exactly what he'd refused to do to Zara's mind but would eventually be forced to do.

_More. Deeper. This is what it will feel like. Being inside her. Taking everything. No privacy. No protection. Just you and her trauma and her desperate need for answers._

His hands tightened on her hips, fingers digging in with enhanced strength. This was wrong. This was practice for something he'd sworn not to do. But his body kept moving, kept thrusting, kept—

_This is training. Learning how to violate her properly. How to be inside her without breaking her. How to take everything she offers and use it against her._

He felt his control dissolving—not the partial loss with Zara, but total abandonment. The predator learning new hunting grounds. The violation artist. The mind-rapist he'd refused to become.

_Yes! This! Learn it! Know it! So when she finally makes you enter her mind, you'll know exactly how to destroy her properly!_

His hands moved to her throat—phantom throat—and squeezed while he thrust harder.

_Yes! This is what you'll do! Control her body while you violate her mind! Total domination! Complete invasion!_

And he did. He let the monster learn new ways to hurt, new territories to invade. His climax built with terrifying intensity—not just physical but something darker. A rehearsal for the violation he'd refused but would eventually commit.

_Yes! Mine! Practice on me! Learn on me! So when you finally do it to her, you'll be perfect!_

When it ended, he found himself on the bathroom floor, gasping, his hand pressed against the cool tile where her throat had been. Alone. Had always been alone.

But the sensations had been real. The lesson had been real. The practice violation had been real.

And that was the horror of it.

_See?_ Her voice was soft now, satisfied. _Now you know. What it feels like to violate someone completely. To be inside them without consent. To take everything._

He stared at his hand—the one that had crushed her phantom throat. The one that was learning to be gentle enough for neural extraction. The one that would eventually enter Zara's mind and pull out her darkest secrets.

"What have I done?"

_Prepared. Practiced. Learned how to be the monster she needs._ She materialized beside him. _You tried to protect her from this. Tried to refuse. But she pushed you here. Made you dangerous. And now you're learning to be dangerous in new ways._

"This isn't real. You're not real."

_The practice was real. The lessons are real. The skills you're learning are real._ She smiled. _And when she comes back demanding the neural bridge, you'll use everything I taught you. You'll enter her mind. You'll violate her completely. You'll become the monster she's begging for._

"I won't."

_You will. Because she won't stop pushing. Because your protection already failed. Because you cracked tiles trying to refuse her, so you'll crack her mind open when she demands it._ Her voice turned gentle. _And I'll be there. Teaching you. Guiding you. Making sure you do it right._

She leaned close, phantom lips near his ear.

_I'm the only place you can practice violation. The only one you can destroy while learning. And you'll need that practice. Because when you finally enter her mind, you need to know how to be thorough without being destructive._

"That's not—"

_It's exactly why this happened. You need to learn. And I'm the only safe place to learn._ Her finger pressed against his lips. _So thank me. For being your training ground. Your practice victim. Your safe place to be a monster._

She faded slowly, her presence dissipating like smoke, leaving only her final whisper:

_Next time she pushes, you'll be ready. You'll know how to violate her properly. Because I taught you._

Kyr4n sat on the cold bathroom floor, alone with the horror of what had just happened. Alone with the knowledge that some part of him had been learning. Had been practicing. Had been preparing for the violation he'd sworn to refuse.

And the worst part, the truly damning part, was knowing she was right.

He would enter Zara's mind eventually. Would violate her neural architecture the way she was demanding. Would use the skills Evilisa was teaching him.

Because Zara wouldn't stop pushing. Because his protection had already failed. Because cracked tiles proved he couldn't keep refusing.

And Evilisa would be there, guiding him through the violation. Teaching him how to be the monster inside someone's mind.

The only place the monster could practice was inside his own head.

With the hallucination that was teaching him to be worse.

## Scene Notes - Revised Version

**This version reveals:**
- Evilisa exploits his guilt about refusing Zara's neural bridge request
- She frames the violation as "practice" for the inevitable neural extraction
- She positions herself as training ground for learning to violate minds
- Uses his understanding that his protection backfired against him
- Predicts (correctly) that Zara will return with stronger demands
- Turns his fear of violating Zara's mind into rehearsal with her
- Makes the assault about preparing him for the violation he'll be forced to commit

**Why this version is more horrifying:**
- Not just assault but training for future assault
- She's teaching him skills he'll use on someone real
- Exploits his guilt about refusing help
- Makes him complicit in preparing to violate Zara
- Uses his care for Zara as weapon to violate him
- Reframes assault as necessary preparation
- He's learning to be a mind-rapist while trying to avoid being one

**Connection to new narrative:**
- Directly follows his understanding that his protection failed
- Uses Evilisa's prediction that Zara will push harder
- Exploits his guilt about tiles/physical danger
- Makes him practice the mental violation he refused
- Sets up that he's "prepared" when Zara eventually demands neural bridge
- Shows Evilisa actively training him to do what he doesn't want to do

**Thematic implications:**
- Protection that becomes violation through denial
- Learning to hurt in new ways while trying to avoid old ways
- The horror of being taught by your own damage
- Complicity through preparation
- How refusing one violation leads to practicing for another

**Content Warning Reminder:** This scene depicts psychological violation, manipulation, and assault. The "practice" framing makes it more disturbing as Evilisa uses his future inevitable violation of Zara to justify current violation of him.
