## Kyr4n's POV

The South Shore's morning air carried the usual industrial tang—recycled water processing, synthetic protein production, the ever-present metallic undertone of poverty and survival. Kyr4n walked with Zara through the market district toward the new water infrastructure site, discussing flow capacity and filtration efficiency.

"The old system was losing forty percent to leaks," he said, reviewing data on his pad. "Corporate neglect compounded by—"

His spatial awareness flared. Object incoming, high trajectory, accelerating downward. Electromagnetic signature: military-grade smart ordnance with proximity fusing.

Three seconds to impact.

His body moved before conscious thought completed the calculation. He grabbed Zara's tactical vest with both hands, pivoted his entire body weight into rotational momentum, and _threw_ her.

She flew backward eight feet, augmented reflexes barely registering the sudden displacement before she hit the ground and rolled.

The grenade landed two feet from where she'd been standing.

One second.

Kyr4n's enhanced reflexes calculated trajectory, blast radius, his position. He moved—fast, that inhuman speed—diving toward cover.

Not fast enough.

The explosion was professional. Shaped charge, directional fragmentation, designed to shred rather than scatter. The concussive force caught him mid-dive, throwing him into the side of a vendor stall. Something cracked in his chest—ribs, maybe worse. Pain bloomed through his torso like fire.

He hit concrete, gasping, tasting copper.

His spatial awareness screamed warnings through the ringing in his ears. Threat still active. Shooter repositioning for confirmation shot. Distance: three hundred meters, elevated position, electromagnetic signature of a high-powered rifle charging.

The nanobotic virus surged through his system, responding to trauma, flooding damaged tissue with repair protocols, heightening his senses, preparing his body for violence. Dark instincts rising like a tide. The part of him that wasn't entirely human anymore, that existed to survive, to _kill_ what threatened survival.

He felt it spreading—electromagnetic field extending, spatial awareness sharpening to painful clarity, every living thing within fifty meters registering in his consciousness like targets waiting to be eliminated.

Not safe. Not for anyone nearby.

## Zara's POV

One moment Zara was walking beside Kyr4n discussing water filtration. The next she was flying backward, hitting the ground hard enough to activate her augmented shock absorption systems.

Her tactical wetware processed: _Thrown. By Kyr4n. Why?_

Then the explosion answered the question.

Grenade detonation, shaped charge pattern, professional ordnance. The vendor stall where Kyr4n had been standing erupted in fragmentation and fire. Bodies scattered—civilians diving for cover, screaming.

Kyr4n's body flew sideways, hit concrete, went down.

Zara was moving before the debris finished falling, her enhanced speed closing the distance. Tactical assessment: primary target down, secondary strike incoming, need cover immediately.

She reached him in two seconds. He was conscious—eyes open, breathing shallow, blood on his lips. But something was wrong with his expression. The analytical calm was gone. In its place: something cold and dark and utterly inhuman staring out from behind his eyes.

"Boss—" she started, reaching for him.

"Don't." His voice was rough, wrong. "Get back."

"You're injured, I need to—"

"Zara." He met her eyes, and what she saw there made her augmented combat systems flash warning signals she'd never seen before. Pure predatory threat. Lethal intent seeking targets. "Get. Back. Call Marcus. Then go get the assassin."

"I'm not leaving you—"

"You have to." His hands clenched, trembling with restraint. "I'm not—right now I'm not safe. For anyone. Marcus can handle me. You need to go."

The sound of charging electronics cut through her protest. High-powered weapon, preparing to fire.

"Sniper," Kyr4n said, his spatial awareness tracking what she couldn't see. "Elevated position, southeast, three hundred meters. Confirmation shot coming. Move. _Now_."

Zara's training overrode her instinct. She grabbed his shoulder, dragged him behind a concrete support pillar—heavy cover, enough to stop rifle rounds. He moved with her but she felt the tension in his body, the barely controlled violence humming beneath his skin.

The moment he had cover, she released him and rolled away as the sniper round cracked past, punching into concrete where his head had been.

"Go," Kyr4n said, his voice carrying command that brooked no argument. "Get them. I'm calling Marcus."

She looked at him once more—saw that darkness in his eyes, saw something moving under his skin that might have been muscle spasms or might have been something worse—and made the tactical decision.

He was right. Whatever state he was in, whoever approached him right now would be in danger. Marcus had five years of trust built up. Marcus could handle extraction.

Her job was neutralizing the threat.

Zara activated her comm. "Marcus, Boss is hit, southeast corner of the market district. He needs immediate extraction. Says he's not safe—handle with caution."

"Understood. Three minutes out."

She switched her tactical overlay to hunter mode, enhanced vision processing trajectory data from the sniper round, calculating position. Southeast, elevated, three hundred meters.

There. Rooftop position, six stories up. Thermal signature fading—shooter already moving.

Professional. Smart. Not waiting for confirmation, already repositioning.

Zara sprinted toward the building, her augmented legs eating distance. Civilians scattered as she moved through the panicked crowd with lethal purpose. Not the bodyguard now. The assassin. The hunter. The thing she'd been trained to be since childhood.

She reached the building in twenty seconds. Found the access—fire escape, rusted but functional. Started climbing, enhanced strength making the ascent rapid. Her tactical systems tracked the shooter's likely escape route. They'd be moving down, not up. Looking for ground-level extraction.

Fourth floor. Fifth. Sixth.

The rooftop access door stood open, swinging in the wind. Fresh scuff marks on the frame. Zara moved through, weapon drawn, scanning.

Empty rooftop. Sniper position obvious—spent brass, heat signature on concrete, weapon mount indentations.

But the shooter was gone. Smart enough not to linger.

Zara's enhanced vision tracked disturbances. Footprints in roof dust, heading toward the northwest corner. She moved silently, predatory grace that made no sound despite her speed.

The northwest fire escape showed signs of recent use. Fresh scrapes on the railing. She leaned over, scanning down—

Movement. Three floors down. Figure in dark tactical gear, descending rapidly.

Zara went over the edge.

Her augmented reflexes and strength made the drop controlled. She landed on the fire escape two floors down, metal groaning under the impact force, and immediately continued pursuit.

The figure below heard her, looked up. Male, augmented, professional tactical gear. His eyes widened—recognition, calculation, decision.

He dropped a flashbang up toward her and jumped.

Zara's enhanced vision systems polarized automatically as the flashbang detonated. The sound still hit her like a hammer—augmented hearing's weakness—but she kept moving, dropping through the dissipating light to land where the shooter had been.

Gone. Into the building through a third-floor window, glass shattered, already inside.

She followed.

The apartment was abandoned—furniture removed, walls bare. The shooter was already through the far door, moving fast. Zara pursued, her tactical overlay mapping the building layout from memory, predicting escape routes.

Hallway. Multiple doors. She tracked fresh disturbances—a door left slightly ajar that should be closed. Moved toward it, weapon ready.

The door exploded outward.

Not literally—the shooter kicked it with augmented strength, using it as a weapon. Zara dropped under it, rolled, came up firing.

The shooter was already moving, combat-trained reflexes matching hers. Enhanced speed, professional technique, military-grade augmentations. He returned fire, rounds sparking off walls as they both moved through the corridor in lethal dance.

Close quarters. No civilians. Pure combat.

Zara felt the familiar cold focus settle over her. This was what she'd been built for. Not protecting static targets. Hunting. Eliminating. The work she'd done for Nexus Industries before breaking free.

She was _good_ at this.

The shooter dove through another doorway. Zara pursued, tactical systems tracking his movement. He was heading for the stairs—ground exit, extraction point probably nearby.

She cut the angle, augmented speed letting her reach the stairwell first. Positioned herself two flights down, weapon trained up.

He came through the door fast, saw her, tried to reverse—

She fired. Three rounds, center mass. His armor held—military-grade plates—but the impact staggered him. She advanced, not giving him recovery time, firing again.

He rolled down the stairs toward her, using gravity and momentum to close distance where her range advantage dominated. Drew a blade mid-roll—vibro-edge, mono-molecular, the kind that cut through armor.

Close combat then. Fine.

Zara holstered her weapon as he came up swinging. The blade hummed through the air where her throat had been. She trapped his wrist, twisted, delivered a knee strike to his ribs that cracked something even through armor.

He grunted, headbutted her with his reinforced skull.

Her augmented bone density held, but the impact rattled her. She released him, created space, drew her own blade.

They circled in the narrow stairwell, two enhanced killers, professional assessment happening in microseconds.

He was good. Military training, combat experience, augmentations that matched or exceeded her own.

But she was better.

She'd been doing this since she was eighteen. Had survived corporate assassination programs that killed most trainees. Had broken free from handlers who'd considered her property and lived to tell about it.

He was a professional.

She was a survivor.

Zara attacked.

The exchange was brutal. Blade against blade, augmented speed making the strikes blur, tactical computers in both their systems calculating trajectories, predicting movements, seeking openings.

She found one.

Feint high, strike low, blade finding the gap between armor plates at his thigh. Mono-molecular edge slicing through synthetic muscle enhancement, biological tissue, femoral artery.

He gasped, staggered, tried to disengage.

She didn't let him. Followed through, trapped his weapon arm, delivered a strike to his throat that crushed his windpipe despite subdermal armor.

He went down, choking, bleeding, systems failing.

Zara stood over him, blade ready for finishing strike, tactical assessment confirming threat neutralization.

Her comm buzzed. Marcus.

"Zara, I have the Boss. He's stable. Extraction complete."

"Copy that. Target neutralized." She looked down at the dying assassin. "Who hired you?"

He tried to speak through his destroyed throat. Failed. Reached for something at his belt—

Zara's blade took his hand off at the wrist. Dead man's switch clattered away, unexploded.

"Smart," she said coldly. "But not smart enough."

She searched him efficiently while he bled out. Found: corporate credentials (false), encrypted comm device (locked), and a data chip in a shielded case.

The assassin's eyes dimmed. Systems failing. Last blood pumping from severed artery. Dead in thirty seconds.

Zara watched without emotion. This was the work. Clean. Efficient. Necessary.

When his vitals flatlined, she took his biometric data—retinal scan, fingerprints, DNA sample. Someone would want to know who'd tried to kill the Boss.

Her comm buzzed again. Marcus.

"Status?"

"Target terminated. Recovering intelligence. Heading back."

"Good work. Boss wants to see you when you return."

Zara gathered the assassin's equipment, leaving the body. Authorities would find it eventually. Let them wonder.

She exited the building through the ground floor, moving through crowds with predatory efficiency, enhanced senses tracking for additional threats. Found none.

The assassination attempt had been professional. Well-planned. Nearly successful. If Kyr4n's spatial awareness hadn't detected the grenade, if his reflexes hadn't thrown her clear, if she hadn't been augmented enough to survive and pursue...

But he had. She had. They'd survived.

And she'd done her job. Protected him by eliminating the threat. Proved she could handle herself even when he was incapacitated.

Earned her place.

She made her way back toward headquarters, the adrenaline fading, professional calm settling back over her enhanced nervous system.

Behind her, a dead assassin lay in a stairwell. In front of her, answers about who wanted the Boss dead and why.

And somewhere between: the memory of darkness in Kyr4n's eyes. The wrongness that had made her combat systems flag him as threat. The thing he'd warned her about—that he wasn't safe, wasn't right, wasn't entirely human when injured and defensive.

She'd seen glimpses before. The strange abilities. The inhuman capabilities. The apex predator hiding behind baseline appearance.

But this had been different. Darker. More primal. The thing that lived underneath when the analytical control slipped.

_What are you?_ she thought again.

But now the question carried less fear. More curiosity. More acceptance.

Whatever he was—baseline human who'd been transformed into something else, creature trying to remain human despite capabilities that suggested otherwise—he'd thrown her clear of an explosion. Had calculated in microseconds that saving her mattered more than avoiding injury himself.

Had protected her. Trusted her to protect him in return.

That meant something.

She walked through the South Shore's morning light, carrying evidence of a failed assassination, heading back to a leader who was more than human but trying very hard to use inhuman capabilities for human purposes.

Her job was protecting him. Understanding what he was... that could wait.

But she was starting to form theories.

And starting to accept that some mysteries were worth protecting even without full understanding.
