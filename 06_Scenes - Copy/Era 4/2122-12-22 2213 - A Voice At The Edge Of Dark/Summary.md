# # A VOICE AT THE EDGE OF DARK

The wasteland ruins are not silent at night.

Wind drags broken sheet metal across concrete and the echoes sound like dying animals. The sky is a smear of dust and clouded moonlight. Nothing grows here. Nothing heals.

It feels appropriate.

Kyr4n moves through the collapsed husk of what once was a transport depot—concrete ribs jutting upward like the bones of something enormous and long dead. He picks a corner where the roof still holds, where shadows pile thick enough to swallow him whole.

He did not bring a light.  
He does not need one.

A low tremor runs through his left hand—viral misfire. It’s getting worse. He steadies the hand against the wall and waits for the shiver to settle. The virus is protesting the choice before he even begins.

“Not tonight,” he murmurs to his own nervous system. “You don’t get to win this argument.”

He sits on the cold ground, legs folding with the tiredness of someone who hasn’t slept more than minutes at a time in weeks. His breath fogs faintly in the air.

He opens the metal case.

Inside, a syringe filled with a black, iridescent fluid, a smaller one containing a neural sedative, a folded piece of paper with his handwriting on it: _In case I fail._    

He leaves the note untouched.

The syringe glints under the moonlight—a thin, wicked thing. The solution inside is the culmination of months of secret research: a nanobot inhibitor, designed to cascade through his bloodstream and shut down the virus by force.

Because once the virus shuts down, it shuts down _him_ with it.  
Heart, lungs, brain. All powered, regulated, repaired by the same system.

Kill the virus, kill the man.

He draws in a breath, slow and steady. His chest aches—not from fear, but from how deeply the virus is woven into his every cell.

A decade of co-existence.  
A decade of compromise.  
A decade of becoming something he was never meant to be.

His fingers trace the edge of the syringe.

“So this is where I stop breaking things,” he says softly, almost amused. “Good.”

He rolls up his sleeve.

The skin beneath is pale, shot through with faint UV-visible threads of circuitry—viral fractal patterns. In the moonlight, they shimmer like ghostly tattoos.

He swabs the injection site with alcohol even though there is no one here to judge his technique.

Old habits.  
Precision until the end.

The neural sedative comes first. A small dose, injected with practiced ease. A warmth spreads through his body within seconds—his thoughts soften at the edges, the constant hum of viral processes beginning to fade into a distant static.

He exhales.

For the first time in years, the pain in his spine goes quiet.

Not gone.  
Just quiet.

It scares him more than the pain ever did.

He picks up the main syringe.

His hand does not shake now—the sedative has done its work. His thoughts drift, becoming slow, syrup-thick, dissolving into a strange peace he barely recognizes.

He presses the needle to his arm.

“What an anticlimax,” he murmurs. “After everything.”

He pushes the plunger.

The inhibitor enters his bloodstream like ice water. He feels the virus react instantly—panic, resistance, a burst of electromagnetic flicker that sparks harmlessly against the metal debris around him.

Kyr4n lies on his side in the dark of the ruin, air scraping shallowly through his throat. The neural sedative has muted the panic, softened the edges of thought, and now the darkness is approaching in slow waves.

His fingers twitch once.  
Then become still.

The wind shifts outside, carrying the cold scent of rust and old concrete dust. 

He closes his eyes.

_It’s done._

For the first time in years, the background hum of the virus falls silent.  
No static behind his thoughts.  
No electromagnetic pulse thudding faintly beneath his breath.

Just… quiet.

He exhales, a slow surrender.

The world is dissolving.

Then—  
somewhere behind him—  
a faintest suggestion of footsteps.

Not clear.  
Not crisp.  
Just… a shift.  
A pressure in the air, the way dust changes its pattern when someone enters a room.

Kyr4n’s eyes flutter open.

No one is there.

He closes them again.

Another shift.  
Closer.

A warmth brushes his fingertips—light as static.  
It could be wind, or the sedative numbing his senses.

Or a hand.

“Kyry?”

The voice is barely audible, like someone speaking from the end of a very long hallway.  
Soft. Familiar. Echoed, as though played through a memory.

His breath stutters.

Riley?

“Kyry, look at me.”

The voice is closer now.  
But not solid.  
Not grounded.  
It trembles in the air like a hologram glitching between frames.

Kyr4n forces his eyes open.

A figure kneels beside him.

Not clearly.  
Not fully.  
The features are blurred, as if the moonlight can’t decide what to illuminate.  
A shape of a man.  
Shoulders he once leaned on.  
Hands he once trusted.  
A face half-formed.

But the eyes—  
brown, soft, impossible—  
flicker into existence for just a moment.

“Hey,” the figure whispers. “You went quiet on me.”

Kyr4n’s throat closes.

“Riley…?”

The figure tilts his head.  
A smile appears briefly, vanishes, returns at a different angle.  
Like the memory can’t keep still.

“You always find the worst places to lie down,” the voice says.

Kyr4n tries to reach for him. His hand passes through air—  
or maybe through a shoulder that wasn’t fully there.  
He can’t tell.

“Are you real?” Kyr4n whispers.

The figure laughs softly.  
But the laugh echoes wrong, bending at the edges.

A warmth envelops Kyr4n’s cheek, but when he attempts to lean into it, the warmth shifts—like a hand pulling away the second he touches it, or like his nerves misfiring a simulation of touch they desperately crave.

“You’re dying,” the figure says gently.  
“Don’t do it alone.”

Kyr4n shuts his eyes.  
The inhibitor makes it harder to think, harder to breathe, harder to fight the swell of grief.

“I tried,” he whispers. “I didn’t want… anyone to see.”

A soft exhale—like someone who once breathed beside him in shared bunk beds, during long cold nights.

“I know,” the voice says. “But even then, I never listened to you very well.”

The figure shifts closer.  
Maybe.  
The darkness makes it impossible to tell where his outline ends and where shadow begins.

Kyr4n feels warmth against his forehead—  
for a heartbeat.

Then nothing.

Then warmth again.

As if reality flickers between frames and can’t agree.

“Kyry,” the voice murmurs. “Stay with me.”

“Are you really here?” Kyr4n breathes.

The figure’s edges blur, dissolve, coalesce again.

“Do you want me to be?” it answers softly.

Kyr4n can’t respond.  
The darkness pulls harder now, like a tide dragging him under.  
His pulse is a faint, weakening tap.

The last thing he sees is the shape of Riley—  
or the idea of Riley—  
leaning close.

Not fully here.  
Not fully gone.

A liminal presence at the threshold of life and death.

“It’s alright,” the voice whispers.  
“I’m right here.”

His breath stops.

The ruin goes silent.

And the figure—whatever it was—  
fades like mist,  
or steps back into shadow,  
or was never there at all.

There is no certainty.  
Only the echo of a voice—  
warm, impossible, gone.
