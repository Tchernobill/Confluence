# Scene Addition: Elevator Descent

**Phoenix Rising - Elevator**  
**POV: Riley**

---

The elevator doors closed, sealing Riley and Zara into the small space. The descent began with a subtle lurch.

For the first three floors, neither spoke.

Then Zara broke the silence. "He doesn't let many people see him like that."

Riley glanced at her. She stood facing forward, watching the floor numbers descend, but her posture had shifted fractionally—less bodyguard, more person.

"Like what?" Riley asked, though he suspected he knew.

"Vulnerable. Uncertain." She paused. "Human."

"He's always been human. Just got better at hiding it."

Zara's dark eyes flicked toward him, assessing. "You knew him before."

"Before the virus, before this, yeah. We were friends when he ran Phoenix Recovery." Riley leaned against the elevator wall, watching her watch him. "You're wondering if I'm going to be a problem."

The corner of her mouth twitched. "Direct. I like that."

"The road teaches you not to waste words." Riley paused. "For what it's worth, I'm not interested in causing trouble. He's still my friend. That doesn't change because he's running a bigger operation now."

"Most people would walk away. Safer that way."

"Probably." Riley considered that. "But he asked me not to. And I'm not built to abandon people who matter just because things get complicated."

Zara was quiet for a moment, and Riley caught something shift in her expression—subtle recognition, maybe respect. "He needs that. People who stay."

"Seems like he's got a few already." Riley tilted his head toward her. "You, for one."

"I'm paid to stay."

"You're paid to protect him. Being his friend—that's a choice you made." Riley kept his voice gentle. "He noticed. It meant something to him."

Zara's jaw tightened fractionally, and Riley realized he'd struck something genuine. She turned to face him more directly.

"He tell you how we met?"

"No."

"I was hired to kill him." Said matter-of-factly, like discussing the weather. "Corporate contract. Nexus Industries wanted the Daemon eliminated before he consolidated too much power." Her eyes stayed level on Riley's. "I took the job. Tracked him. Got within striking distance."

Riley kept his expression calm, though his pulse quickened. "What stopped you?"

"He knew I was there. Knew what I was. Could have killed me easily—I felt it, the way he moved, the control he had." She paused. "Instead he offered me a choice. Work for someone who valued me, or keep taking contracts from people who'd throw me away the moment I became inconvenient."

"And you chose him."

"I chose someone who saw me as a person first and a weapon second." Her voice went quieter. "Who called me a friend in front of someone he actually cares about, even though he didn't have to."

Riley understood then. "You're not used to that. People meaning it when they call you friend."

"In my line of work, friendship is usually just delayed betrayal." She looked away. "He's different."

"Yeah." Riley smiled slightly. "He is. Always has been. He'll try to push you away, convince himself you're better off at a distance. But if you stick around anyway, he'll die before he betrays that trust."

"You sound certain."

"I've known him for years. Watched him build consciousness into an AI because he couldn't stand the idea of Sedh being a slave. Saw him protect people he barely knew because it was the right thing to do." Riley's voice went softer. "He's not comfortable with power. Probably never will be. But he's good at using it to protect people who matter to him."

The elevator chimed. Fifth floor.

Zara straightened, bodyguard posture returning as they approached the lobby. But before the doors opened, she looked at Riley one more time.

"You hurt him, I'll know. And corporate training taught me very creative ways to express disappointment."

Riley nodded, acknowledging the threat without flinching. "Fair. But for what it's worth—I'm not planning to. He's had enough people walk away."

"Good." Then, almost as an afterthought: "You're welcome to visit. Scheduled or unscheduled. I'll make sure you're cleared."

The elevator doors opened onto the lobby. Zara's expression shifted back to professional neutrality, dark eyes resuming their constant surveillance of the space.

Riley stepped out, then paused. "Zara?"

She looked at him.

"He's lucky to have you watching his back. Really lucky."

Something flickered across her face—surprise, maybe, or the uncomfortable recognition of sincerity. She gave a single sharp nod.

Riley walked toward the exit, feeling her gaze tracking him until he cleared the door.

Outside, he found his bike right where he'd left it, undisturbed. The South Shore afternoon air carried the usual mix of industrial smells and distant cooking. Normal. Familiar.

He swung onto the bike, started the engine, and pulled away from Phoenix Rising's entrance.

His friend had become a crime lord. His friend had a bodyguard who'd been sent to kill him and stayed instead. His friend was trying to do something impossible—use criminal power for actually protective purposes—while hating almost every minute of it.

The world was complicated. Relationships were complicated.

But Riley had learned long ago that the most valuable friendships were the ones that survived complications.

He'd visit again. Soon, probably.

The road stretched ahead, familiar and free.

But it included Phoenix Rising now. Included Kyry and Zara and Marcus and whatever Alex did with Northside intelligence.

Riley smiled slightly, adjusting his route toward the next delivery.

Some packages, he reflected, delivered more than their contents suggested.

This one had given him back a friend he'd thought was lost.

That was worth a fake delivery request any day.
