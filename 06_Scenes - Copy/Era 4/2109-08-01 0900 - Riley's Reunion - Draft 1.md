# Scene Draft: The Reunion

**Phoenix Rising - Main Lobby**  
**Mid-Era 4 (circa 2111)**  
**POV: Riley**

---

The lobby looked nothing like the places Riley usually delivered to.

Most South Shore operations ran out of repurposed warehouses or salvaged containers, all rusted metal and improvised security. Phoenix Rising occupied what had once been a mid-tier corporate building—actual reinforced concrete, functioning climate control, and polished floors that reflected the overhead lighting. The kind of space that said _we have resources_ without being gaudy about it.

Riley adjusted the package under his arm and approached the reception desk, where a young woman with subtle optical augments tracked his approach with professional assessment.

"Delivery for Phoenix Rising," he said, offering his usual easy smile. "Independent courier, Riley King. Should be on your manifest."

The receptionist's fingers flickered over her interface. "One moment." Her eyes unfocused slightly—neural link verification. "Confirmed. You're expected. If you'll wait in the seating area, someone will be with you shortly."

_Expected?_ Riley kept his expression neutral, but the phrasing caught his attention. Most deliveries involved handing off the package and getting a signature. This felt different.

He settled into one of the waiting area chairs—actual padding, not just molded plastic—and let his gaze drift across the space. Three people occupied the lobby besides the receptionist. Two wore the understated tactical gear of professional security, positioned with the kind of spacing that suggested military training. The third was a woman who stood with her back to the wall, dark eyes tracking every movement in the room with predatory focus.

She noticed his attention and met his gaze directly. Riley offered a polite nod. She didn't respond, just continued her methodical surveillance.

_Professional operation,_ Riley thought. _Very professional._

The elevator chimed. Riley glanced over expecting a courier manager or logistics coordinator.

Kyr4n stepped out.

Riley's mind stuttered over the recognition. It was Kyry—same dark hair, same lean build, same economical movements—but everything else felt wrong. His friend had always carried himself with careful neutrality, blending into crowds, staying small. The man crossing the lobby moved with quiet authority that made the security personnel straighten without conscious thought.

Kyr4n wore dark, well-tailored clothing that managed to look practical without being tactical. No visible augments, no obvious weapons, nothing that screamed _power_. Yet every person in the lobby oriented toward him like iron filings responding to a magnet.

Their eyes met. For a fraction of a second, something flickered across Kyr4n's face—recognition, warmth, maybe relief—then it was gone, replaced by controlled neutrality.

"Riley." Kyr4n's voice was quiet, precise. The same voice Riley remembered, but cooler. More distant. "Thank you for making the delivery personally."

Riley stood, package suddenly feeling very heavy in his hands. "Kyry?" The nickname emerged automatically, colored with confusion and the first edge of concern. "What is this? What are you doing here?"

"I work here." A pause. "I run it, actually."

The words landed like stones in still water. Riley heard them, understood them on some surface level, but they refused to make sense. "You run... Phoenix Rising?" He glanced at the security, the lobby, the woman still watching from the wall. "This is yours?"

"It is."

Riley's mental map of his friend shattered and tried to reassemble around this new information. Kyry, who'd run a small electronics repair shop. Kyry, who'd preferred hiding in the back room to dealing with customers. Kyry, who'd been sick two years ago—viral infection that had scared everyone who cared about him—and then gone quiet. Intermittent messages, vague explanations, growing distance.

"The package," Riley said slowly, because he needed something concrete to anchor to, "this wasn't actually a real delivery, was it?"

"The contents are real. The delivery request was... expedient." Kyr4n's dark eyes remained steady on Riley's face. "I wanted to see you. Thought you might have questions if I called directly."

"Questions." Riley heard his own voice go slightly flat, which rarely happened. "Yeah, friend. I have questions." He looked around the lobby again, really seeing it this time. The professional operation. The military-grade security. The quiet efficiency that spoke of serious resources. "Phoenix Recovery was an electronics shop. This is..."

He couldn't finish the sentence. Didn't have words for what _this_ was.

The woman from the wall moved closer, her posture shifting to something protective without being obvious about it. She stopped a few paces from Kyr4n, close enough to intervene, far enough to give space.

"Zara," Kyr4n said, acknowledging her presence without looking away from Riley. "It's fine."

"Boss." The word was clipped, professional. Her accent carried hints of Middle Eastern heritage beneath the corporate standard.

_Boss._ Riley filed that away with everything else that didn't make sense.

"Riley," Kyr4n continued, "we should talk. Properly. Not in the lobby." He gestured toward the elevator. "Will you come up?"

Every instinct Riley had developed from years of courier work was screaming at him. This was too controlled, too organized, too _wrong_ for the friend he remembered. But beneath the confusion and concern, he heard something in Kyr4n's voice. A question, almost a plea, hidden under the controlled neutrality.

_Please don't walk away. Not yet._

Riley took a slow breath, finding his center the way meditation had taught him. The world could wait three seconds while he chose his response.

"Yeah," he said finally. "Yeah, okay. But Kyry—" He paused, needing his friend to hear this. "You're going to explain what happened. All of it. The shop, the sickness, this." He gestured at the lobby. "Because right now, I don't even know who I'm looking at."

Something flickered in Kyr4n's eyes again—pain, maybe, or regret. "I know." Quiet words, weighted with things unsaid. "That's why I wanted you to come."

Kyr4n turned toward the elevator. Zara fell into position two steps behind him, professional and alert. Riley followed, package still under his arm, feeling like he'd stepped into a scene from someone else's life.

The elevator doors closed on the lobby, on the professional operation, on everything Riley thought he understood about his friend.

Whatever conversation waited on the upper floors, Riley suspected it would rewrite two years of careful assumptions.

He just hoped the person waiting to have that conversation was still someone he recognized.

## Notes for Continuity:

**Character voices maintained:**

- **Riley**: Warm, conversational, uses meditation breathing when stressed, friendly address ("friend"), processes through grounding
- **Kyr4n**: Economical speech, controlled emotions, brief statements, Tommy Shelby-like authority
- **Zara**: Minimal words, professional, protective, one-word responses when possible

**Key setup elements:**

- Riley completely unaware of Kyr4n's criminal organization
- Two-year gap with intermittent contact
- Riley thinks Kyr4n was sick and recovered (doesn't know about virus)
- Shock and concern at transformation
- Kyr4n arranged the delivery to see Riley
- Emotional undercurrent despite surface control

**For next scene:** The private conversation where Kyr4n explains (to whatever degree he chooses) what happened in the two years since Riley last saw him. This will be emotionally complex as Riley processes his friend's transformation into a territorial crime lord.
