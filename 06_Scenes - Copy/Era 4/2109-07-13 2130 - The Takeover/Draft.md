The office was exactly as Marcus had left it two hours ago. Except the positions had changed.

Rico was behind one of his girls now. The rhythmic violence unmistakable. Fresh blood streaked her back. Two others sat in chairs positioned to watch—Jenna and Gillian, if Marcus remembered correctly. Their faces held that particular blankness that came from witnessing atrocities so regularly that reaction itself became dangerous.

Rico glanced up as Marcus entered, his face flushed with exertion and pleasure. Didn't stop what he was doing.

"Ah!" Rico's voice carried theatrical delight. "The famous Artisant!" He punctuated his words with another vicious thrust that drew a strangled gasp from the woman beneath him. "Marcus, bring our guest in. We have such profitable business to discuss."

Marcus's stomach turned. Three years. Never got easier. He kept his face professionally blank and stepped aside, gesturing Kyr4n into the room.

The tech worker entered with that same economical movement, his eyes tracking across the scene with clinical precision. No shock. No disgust. No reaction at all—just systematic observation, like he was cataloguing components in a damaged circuit.

"I've heard some very interesting things about you, Artisant," Rico continued, finally separating from his victim with exaggerated satisfaction. He wiped blood from his hands onto expensive sheets. "Your work is quite remarkable. Almost... extraordinary, one might say." The pause carried weight. Implication. "The kind of extraordinary that makes one wonder about the source of such talent."

Marcus's augmented hearing caught the subtle shift in Rico's tone—the edge of a threat wrapped in pleasantry. Whatever Rico knew or thought he knew about Kyr4n, he was using it as leverage. Standard intimidation tactics.

"I'm certain we can come to a very profitable arrangement," Rico said, moving toward his desk with casual confidence. "You work for me exclusively. I provide protection, resources, access to premium clients. Everyone wins." He settled into his chair, gesturing vaguely toward the bed. "After we conclude our business terms, I might even let you have a test drive of the merchandise." He pointed at the two women still on they chair. "Signing bonus, as it were."

The words tossed off casually. Not an invitation but an afterthought—the kind of perk Rico assumed anyone would want. Marcus had heard similar offers before, watched Rico use his victims as bargaining chips or rewards, another tool in his arsenal of control.

Kyr4n stood perfectly still, his expression unchanged. That flat assessment hadn't wavered, hadn't reacted to either the implied threat or the casual offer. He simply looked at Rico the way someone might look at a malfunctioning piece of equipment.

Then he moved.

Marcus's augmented reflexes should have tracked it. Should have. But something felt wrong—his enhanced vision stuttered, his plated nervous system suddenly sluggish, like trying to run through deep water. The electromagnetic sensors in his forearms registered... something. Interference? Static? His threat assessment protocols flickered with contradictory data.

By the time his confused senses caught up, Kyr4n had crossed the room. His hand found Rico's throat with surgical precision, and suddenly the crime boss was airborne—lifted from his chair and slammed against the wall hard enough to crack the expensive panelling. The impact drove the air from Rico's lungs in a wet gasp.

Marcus's hand moved toward his holster, military training overriding the confusion in his augmented systems.

Empty leather.

His weapon was gone.

Marcus's enhanced vision snapped into focus on the impossible: his own sidearm, the one that had been secured in its holster less than two seconds ago, was now in Kyr4n's left hand. The barrel tracked toward Marcus's face with mechanical precision. Kyr4n held both Rico against the wall with his right hand and Marcus's weapon in his left, as if the laws governing how quickly a human could move had simply stopped applying.

"Biometric locked," Marcus said, his hand already moving toward the backup piece holstered at the small of his back.

His fingers had just brushed the grip when the shot came.

A sharp hiss, like air escaping under pressure, followed by a wave of heat that washed across Marcus's right cheek. The plasma bolt passed close enough that he felt his skin prickle, close enough that the hairs on the side of his face crisped from proximity to superheated matter.

The wall behind him sizzled. The scent of burned paint and scorched composite filled the air—acrid, chemical.

Marcus froze, his hand still on his backup weapon. His augmented vision tracked the scorch mark on the wall—a perfect circle of blackened material, still glowing faintly at the edges. The shot had passed within two centimetres of his ear.

Without Kyr4n ever looking away from Rico.

"Sit down, Sir," Kyr4n said quietly, his tone carrying the same flat certainty he'd used to state he didn't carry weapons.

Marcus's hand moved away from his backup piece, tried to forget the ceramic blades secured in his boot sheaths. His augmented reflexes had calculated the scenario. By the time he could draw and aim, he'd be dead.

He sat.

Rico made a wet, gasping sound as Kyr4n did something Marcus couldn't quite see—a subtle movement of his thumb against the crime boss's neck. Rico's eyes went wide, then unfocused, and his struggling ceased. Not the compliance of someone who'd been choked into submission. Something else. Something deeper.

Then Kyr4n released his grip.

Rico fell—first to his knees, then forward onto his face, his body moving with the slow-motion quality of someone whose nervous system was shutting down. His breathing slowed, became shallow. His eyes remained open but unseeing, and within seconds he'd gone completely still.

Kyr4n moved to the bed. Looked at the injured woman with clinical detachment. Three seconds. That's all he spent on her before turning toward the chairs where Jenna and Gillian sat frozen.

The two women stared at the floor, their bodies rigid with fear. They'd witnessed Rico's violence often enough to know that looking at the wrong person at the wrong time could be fatal.

Kyr4n crossed the room and knelt in front of them, putting himself at eye level. The weapon in his hand still tracked Marcus—keeping him covered while Kyr4n's attention focused elsewhere.

"What are your names?" Kyr4n asked, his voice shifting to something almost soft. Not gentle—there was no warmth in it—but neutral. Conversational, like asking about the weather.

"Jenna," the darker-haired one whispered, still not meeting his eyes.

"Gillian," the other added, her voice trembling.

"What's her name?" Kyr4n tilted his head toward the bed without looking away from them.

"Sarah," Jenna managed.

Kyr4n nodded once. Filing the information away. "Sarah has internal bleeding. Severe broken ribs, trauma to her kidneys and possibly her spleen. She's also beginning a drug overdose. She will die within thirty minutes."

The clinical precision of the diagnosis made Marcus's augmented systems flag another contradiction. That level of medical knowledge didn't come from street first aid.

"Can either of you drive?" Kyr4n asked.

Gillian nodded, still staring at the floor. "Yes."

"Good." Kyr4n's voice stayed quiet. "Take Sarah to the alley behind The Greenfield Towers, building five. A man will be waiting for you. Go now. Twenty-nine minutes."

The two women moved swiftly, like people who'd been given permission to leave a nightmare. They had Sarah wrapped in sheets and supported between them in seconds, moving toward the door without a backward glance.

Marcus watched them go, his mind calculating angles. "Where are you sending them?"

Kyr4n ignored him completely, rising to his feet and moving to Rico's desk. He picked up the communicator—Rico's personal unit, encrypted and supposedly secure—and activated it with a touch. Whatever security Rico had installed apparently didn't matter.

"It's Kyr4n," he said into the device, his tone shifting back to that flat, business-like cadence. "Sending you someone to the door. One woman in critical state, less than sixty minutes, and two escorting her. Do your best for the woman. Keep the two others in the resting area, get them food, offer them a sleeping pod if they want it. Update me on the situation at this comm unit. Yeah, We'll talk later. Bye."

He cut the connection and put the communicator in his pocket, then simply... stopped.

For several seconds, Kyr4n stood there, staring at nothing. Marcus caught the subtle tremor in his hands—barely visible, but present. The weapon lowered slightly, no longer aimed with that mechanical precision. His breathing had changed too. Slightly faster. Shallower.

Adrenaline crash. Marcus recognized the signs. Whatever had just happened, Kyr4n was coming down from it now. The chemical certainty of combat giving way to something else.

Then Kyr4n let himself fall into Rico's chair, the expensive leather creaking under his weight. He set the weapon on the desk and stared at it like he wasn't quite sure how it had gotten there.

Marcus studied him carefully, his threat assessment protocols still confused but starting to piece together a picture. This wasn't a planned takeover. This was someone who'd reacted—violently, efficiently, impossibly—and was now sitting in the aftermath with no idea what came next.

The silence stretched. Marcus watched Kyr4n sit motionless in Rico's chair, watched his eyes track across the office like he was seeing it for the first time. No triumph. No satisfaction. Just emptiness. Like someone who'd solved a problem and was now realizing they had no idea what to do with the solution. Marcus got a suggestion.

Finally, Marcus spoke. "What now, Boss?"

Kyr4n's head snapped up, those steel-coloured eyes focusing on him with sudden intensity. "What?"

"What now? Boss."

"I'm not—" Kyr4n stopped, his jaw working like he was trying to find words that wouldn't come. "I'm not your boss. I'm just..."

"You just eliminated Rico Vasquez. Took over his office. Sent three of his assets to what I assume is medical care. You have his personal comm unit in your pocket." Marcus leaned forward slightly. "Whether you planned it or not, you just took his territory."

"No." Kyr4n shook his head. "I'm leaving. This wasn't—"

"You think you can just walk away?" Marcus interrupted, and now his tone carried an edge. "Rico's lieutenants will hear about this, they will come for you. His suppliers, they'll come for everything you have. His rivals, they'll come for this place. You just created a power vacuum in one of the unstable territories in the South Shore Slum. You walk away now, this place tears itself apart in under a week."

Kyr4n stared at him, confusion replacing that clinical assessment for the first time since he'd stepped off the elevator. "That's not my problem."

"Isn't it?" Marcus gestured toward the door where Jenna and Gillian had disappeared. "You just sent three women to medical care. Fancy care, from the sound of that call. You care enough to fix the immediate damage. What happens when Rico's operation collapses? Two hundred more working girls end up on the street. His protection rackets fold. Small businesses get torn apart by whoever moves in to fill the void."

"I repair electronics," Kyr4n said, but his voice had lost certainty. "I don't run criminal empires."

"You just took over one." Marcus stood slowly, keeping his hands visible. "Whether you want it or not, you need to decide what happens next. Because right now, I'm the only thing standing between you and every enforcer in this building wondering why their boss won't answer his comm."

Kyr4n's hands had stopped trembling. His eyes tracked across the office again, but this time Marcus could see him calculating. Processing. That same clinical assessment he'd applied to Sarah's injuries now turned toward the problem of organizational control.

"I don't want this," Kyr4n said finally.

"I know." Marcus took a calculated risk, moving closer to one of the chairs and sitting down—putting himself at eye level, removing the hierarchical distance. "But you're good at it. I just watched you neutralize the most dangerous man in forty blocks. You moved faster than my combat augs could track. Military specs. You fired my biometrically locked weapon like it was nothing. At this stage, I'm not even wondering why Rico's defensives gear didn't even warmed up"

He paused.

"You're wasted fixing broken equipment in the back of a repair shop."

"I like fixing equipment," Kyr4n said, and there was something almost plaintive in his tone. Like he was defending the last piece of normalcy in a life that had just been forcibly reorganized.

"You can still fix things." Marcus leaned forward. "But you can also fix this. Prevent the territory from going to hell. Maybe even improve it a bit."

Kyr4n studied him with that flat assessment. "You're really selling it."

"Consider this: You walk away, you're condemning this territory to something worse." Marcus played his final card. "Rico kept stability through fear. With him gone, every ambitious enforcer and rival boss will move in. The violence you just stopped in this room? It'll spread across twelve blocks. You walk away, next sunrise brings hell for everyone."

The words hung in the air between them. Marcus watched Kyr4n process the logic, saw the exact moment when the clinical assessment reached its inevitable conclusion.

Kyr4n closed his eyes. "Fuck."

"Yeah."

Silence. The electromagnetic hum of the building's systems. The faint smell of burned paint from the scorch mark on the wall.

Finally, Kyr4n opened his eyes. "One condition."

"I'm listening."

"Between you and me. It's unconditional." Kyr4n's voice had gone flat again, that clinical detachment reasserting itself. "One day—might be next month, might be ten years—if I ask you to kill me, you do it. No questions. No hesitation. No trying to talk me out of it. Just do it."

"Wha—"

"This deal states 'no questions'."

Marcus had just insisted he knew how to help run a criminal empire built on violence and fear. He didn't get to draw moral lines about suicide pacts.

"If that day comes," Marcus said slowly, choosing his words with care, "I'll do it. Clean. Professional. You won't see it coming."

"Thank you." Kyr4n's shoulders sagged slightly, tension bleeding out. "Fine. You help me stabilize this situation. We reform the operation into something less horrific. Then I go back to fixing smaller things."

"Deal." Marcus stood, extending his hand across the desk.

Kyr4n looked at it for a moment—that clinical assessment calculating handshake protocols and symbolic gestures—then reached out and gripped it firmly. His hand was warm. Pulse steady despite the adrenaline crash.

Human.

"So what now?" Kyr4n asked. "Actually what now. Not the rhetorical version."

Marcus released his grip and moved toward the door. "Now I lock this office. Tell the building we're not to be disturbed. We go through Rico's files. Every lieutenant. Every operation. Every debt and obligation. You need to know what you just inherited before we start making changes."

He pointed at Rico. "Also need to dispose of him discreetly."

"I'll handle that myself. Few hours."

"That's not cryptic at all."

"Get used to it." Kyr4n moved toward the terminal, his fingers already accessing files with practiced efficiency. "If we're doing this, we're doing it my way. I need to know how this operation work, from inside-out, the more I know, the more effective I get."

"Fair enough, Boss."

Kyr4n winced at the title. "Don't call me that."

"No problem, Sir."

Kyr4n smirked back at him.

Despite everything—the violence, the impossible speed, the weapon that shouldn't work, the deal he'd just made to kill this man on request—Marcus found himself almost smiling.

The South Shore Slum had a new player.

And Marcus had just become his right hand.
