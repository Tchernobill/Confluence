The South Shore's open-air market sprawled across three blocks of cracked pavement, a maze of vendor stalls selling everything from grey-market pharmaceuticals to bootleg neural interfaces. The air smelled of fried synthetic protein, ozone from poorly-shielded electronics, and the ever-present undertone of industrial runoff from the nearby water treatment facility.

Marcus walked with military precision through the crowds, his augmented eyes cataloguing threats and exit routes by habit. Kyr4n kept pace beside him, hands in pockets, apparently listening to Marcus's briefing on protection payment schedules and territorial boundaries but showing no tactical awareness whatsoever. No scanning of exits. No threat assessment. Just walking through a dangerous market like it was a corporate district promenade.

"The southeast corner vendors have been reliable," Marcus was saying. "They understand the arrangement—we keep corporate raids out, they—"

"Marcus Chen. Still walking like you've got a drill sergeant watching."

The voice cut through the market noise with familiar confidence. Marcus turned, his stern expression cracking into something almost like a smile.

Zara approached through the crowd with the fluid grace of an apex predator, her compact frame somehow commanding space despite being surrounded by people. Dark curly hair pulled back in a practical ponytail. Combat boots and tactical gear that managed to look casual. Eyes that missed nothing, enhanced senses processing data streams that baseline humans couldn't perceive.

"Zara Al-Rashid." Marcus's voice carried genuine warmth. "Thought you were working the Corporate District these days."

"Contract finished." She clasped his forearm in the warrior's greeting, grinning. "Heard you were still playing enforcer for Rico Vasquez. Should've checked on you—nobody deserves working for that piece of shit."

"Didn't work _for_ Rico," Marcus corrected, his tone careful. "Worked for the territory. Different thing."

"Sure." She waved dismissively. Then her expression shifted, voice dropping slightly. "You hear what happened to him? Someone finally put him down two weeks ago. Whole inner circle, gone. Clean sweep."

"I heard."

Something in his tone made her study him more carefully. "You were there when it happened?"

"I was there."

Her eyes narrowed. "And you're still breathing. So either you helped, or whoever did it wanted you alive." She paused, reading his expression. "You helped?"

"No." Marcus shook his head. "But I didn't stop it either."

"Smart man." She glanced around the market, professional habit. "So who's running things now? Someone brought in muscle from outside?"

"No." Marcus gestured to Kyr4n, who'd been standing quietly beside him the entire conversation. "He took over the territory."

Zara's gaze slid over Kyr4n for perhaps half a second—automatic threat assessment, instant result. Baseline human, no visible augmentations, average build, hands in pockets, zero tactical awareness, no weapon profile, unthreatening posture. Her enhanced senses registered: not a combatant, not a threat, probably technical support.

She looked back at Marcus. "Your tech guy?"

"My boss," Marcus said simply.

Silence stretched for two seconds while Zara processed that. Then she smiled, not quite laughing but close. "Marcus, come on. You're telling me this—" She glanced at Kyr4n again, seeing: no scars, no augmentations, standing with his weight wrong for any combat stance she knew. "—_he_ took down Rico Vasquez?"

"Yes."

"The Grip. Rico 'I've killed twelve people with my bare hands' Vasquez." Her tone suggested she was waiting for the punchline.

"That one."

Zara studied Kyr4n again, really looked this time. He met her gaze with calm interest, like she was evaluating a piece of equipment he'd built rather than assessing him as a potential threat. No defensive posture. No attempt to present himself as dangerous. Just... standing there.

"You're serious," she said, more statement than question.

"Completely."

"Huh." She crossed her arms, tactical wetware running scenarios. "Well. Someone's going to try collecting on him soon anyway. Word came through guild networks three days ago—contract for fifty thousand credits. Rico's remaining lieutenants want revenge." She looked at Kyr4n with something like professional sympathy. "No offense, but you might want to hire actual security. That's decent money, and you look like you'd have trouble winning a bar fight."

Kyr4n tilted his head slightly. "Is fifty thousand the standard rate for this type of contract?"

"Depends on the target. For someone who supposedly killed The Grip?" She shrugged. "It's about right. Although honestly, looking at you, I'm starting to wonder if maybe Rico died of a heart attack and someone's taking credit."

"He didn't," Marcus said, his tone leaving no room for debate. "And before you consider taking that contract, you should know—people who've tried to come after him haven't ended well."

Zara raised an eyebrow. "People have tried already?"

"Two attempts in the first week. Both professionals. Both failed."

"Failed how?"

Marcus's expression went carefully neutral. "Definitively."

The way he said it—not boastful, not threatening, just matter-of-fact—made Zara's tactical systems flag a warning. Marcus Chen didn't exaggerate threats. If he said attempts had failed definitively, that meant bodies, not captures.

But looking at Kyr4n, she couldn't square it. He wasn't scanning the market. Wasn't watching her hands. Had made no move to adjust his position when she'd approached Marcus, hadn't even bothered to face her directly for the first part of their conversation. Every tactical instinct she had screamed: _vulnerable target, zero combat awareness, easy mark._

"So what, he's got some kind of hidden security team?" she asked.

"Something like that," Marcus said vaguely. "The point is, if you're thinking about that contract, don't. Instead, consider legitimate employment. We need someone to handle personal security. Someone with your skill set."

Zara snorted. "You want me to babysit?"

"I want you to do what you're good at—keep people alive. The pay's better than contract work, more stable, and significantly lower mortality risk."

"For _me_ or for him?" She nodded toward Kyr4n.

"Both," Marcus said seriously.

Before Zara could respond, Kyr4n spoke for the first time, his voice flat and analytical. "From a purely economic perspective, the employment offer has better expected value than the contract. Recurring income versus one-time payment, legal protection within the territory, and Marcus's assessment of the contract's mortality risk should probably factor into your decision since you trust his tactical judgment."

Zara stared at him. "Did you just cost-benefit analyze your own assassination?"

"Risk assessment," Kyr4n corrected mildly. "It's relevant to both our interests."

She looked at Marcus. "Is he always like this?"

"Yes."

"Christ." Zara studied Kyr4n again, noting details: no reaction to her professional assessment of him as a target, no defensive posture despite discussing attempts on his life, hands still in his pockets like he was discussing weather patterns. Either he was completely naive about the danger he was in, or...

Or Marcus was right and there was something she was missing.

"Okay," she said slowly. "Let's say I'm interested. But I need to know what I'm signing up for. How did you actually take down Rico?"

"Efficiently," Kyr4n said.

"That's not an answer."

"It's the only one you need right now," Marcus interjected. "What you need to know is that he took over the territory, he's rebuilding how it operates, and yes, people want him dead. Your job would be keeping that from happening."

Zara made a decision. She needed more data, and there was a simple test that would tell her a lot.

In one fluid movement, she closed the distance between them, invading Kyr4n's personal space in a way that made most people flinch or step back. Enhanced reflexes, combat-optimized neural patterns—most humans' hindbrain screamed danger when a predator moved into their bubble like that.

Kyr4n didn't move. No defensive reaction at all. He just looked at her with mild curiosity, like he was wondering what she was doing but not particularly concerned about it.

_No training,_ she noted. _Zero defensive instinct._

Before Marcus could react, she slapped him. Not full force—she wasn't trying to actually hurt him, just testing reflexes and pain response. Still hard enough that it should have drawn some reaction.

His head moved slightly with the impact. Maybe an inch. Then he blinked once and turned his head back to center, meeting her eyes again. No anger. No defensive posture. No hand coming up to his cheek. Just that same calm interest, like she'd tapped him on the shoulder.

"Did you get the information you needed?" he asked, tone genuinely curious.

Zara stepped back, processing. High pain tolerance, or maybe too surprised to react properly. But more importantly: no training. None. A trained fighter would have blocked, deflected, or at minimum shifted weight defensively. He'd done nothing but stand there and take it.

"Yeah," she said. "I got what I needed." She looked at Marcus. "If I take this job, we've got a lot of work to do. He doesn't know the first thing about personal defense."

"That's why we need you," Marcus said.

Zara turned back to Kyr4n, professional assessment mode. "Okay. First thing we do is basic situational awareness training. You're walking through a hostile market like you're on a corporate campus. That gets you killed. Second, we work on defensive positioning, threat recognition, and—"

"I'm not a fighter," Kyr4n said simply.

Marcus's eyebrow rose slightly at that, an expression Zara caught but couldn't quite interpret. Surprise? Amusement?

"Then we teach you to be one," Zara said flatly. "Or at least teach you enough to stay alive for the thirty seconds it takes me to reach you when something goes wrong. That's non-negotiable. If I'm protecting you, you need minimum basic defensive skills."

"That seems reasonable," Kyr4n agreed. "When would training start?"

"As soon as we finalize employment terms," Zara said. She looked at Marcus. "Standard security rates plus combat training hours?"

"We can work out the details," Marcus confirmed. "You're hired if you want the job."

Zara studied Kyr4n one more time. No visible augmentations, no combat training, apparently took over a criminal territory through means she couldn't identify. Marcus trusted him, which counted for a lot. And fifty thousand credits as a one-time payment versus steady work with training duties...

The math actually did favor the legitimate job.

"Fine," she said. "I'll do it. But—" She looked pointedly at Kyr4n. "—you actually have to show up for training. Can't protect someone who won't learn basic defense."

"Understood," Kyr4n said. "I'll follow whatever protocols you establish."

"Good." She extended her hand for a professional handshake. "Welcome to having a babysitter who's going to make you run drills until you stop standing around like a target."

Kyr4n shook her hand, his grip completely normal—no hidden augmentation she could detect, just regular human strength. "Welcome to the organization."

Marcus looked satisfied. "I'll show you the security setup and current threat assessments. We can start the training schedule tomorrow."

As they began walking through the market, Zara fell into professional formation—slightly ahead and to the left, where she could intercept threats approaching Kyr4n. She watched his movement, cataloguing everything wrong with it. No tactical awareness. No threat scanning. Walking with both hands in his pockets, for fuck's sake.

_This is going to be like training a civilian from scratch,_ she thought. _How the hell did this guy take down The Grip?_

Marcus caught her expression and smiled slightly. "You'll figure it out."

"Figure out what?"

"Why I'm not worried about his safety despite what you're seeing."

Zara frowned. "He's got hidden security I can't detect?"

"Something like that," Marcus said vaguely. "Give it time. The picture will become clearer."

Ahead of them, Kyr4n had paused at a vendor stall selling circuit components, examining something with calm focus, completely oblivious to the two gang members eyeing him from across the way—obvious predatory interest in the baseline human who looked lost.

Zara's hand moved instinctively toward her weapon, but the gang members suddenly found somewhere else to be, moving away quickly.

She frowned. That was odd. They'd locked onto him like he was easy prey, then just... left.

"Did you do something?" she asked Marcus quietly.

"No." He was watching Kyr4n with something like amusement. "They figured it out on their own."

"Figured out what?"

"That some prey isn't prey at all."

Before Zara could ask what the hell that meant, Kyr4n turned back to them, circuit component in hand. "Ready to continue?"

"Stay close," Zara said automatically, professional instinct. "And keep your hands out of your pockets. Slows reaction time."

"Noted," Kyr4n said, but his hands stayed exactly where they were.

Zara sighed. Training was going to be interesting.

But as they walked through the market and she watched Kyr4n's complete lack of defensive awareness, she couldn't shake one question: How does someone with zero combat training take over a criminal territory?

Marcus had said people who tried for him "ended definitively." But looking at Kyr4n, she couldn't see how. No weapons. No augmentations. No training.

_Give it time,_ Marcus had said. _The picture will become clearer._

Fine. She'd give it time.

But she was also going to make damn sure he learned basic defensive skills, because whatever hidden advantage he had clearly wasn't stopping him from being completely tactically incompetent in daily situations.

First training session was going to be brutal.
