title: The Interrogation
---
The detention chamber smelled like fear-sweat and recycled air. Thirty-five minutes since they'd snatched Harrison Wells from his corporate vehicle. Less than an hour before his absence triggered automated security protocols that would blanket the South Shore with surveillance drones.

Zara stood against the concrete wall, arms crossed, watching the technical team fail.

"Neural locks are military-grade," Maya announced, pulling back from her diagnostic interface. "Quantum-encrypted, self-modifying algorithms. I can't touch them without triggering a cascade that wipes everything."

"Try the bioelectric bypass," Kaia suggested, fingers flying across her own terminal.

"Already attempted. The locks adapt faster than I can probe. It's learning from my attempts." Maya's frustration bled through her professional tone. "This isn't standard corporate security. This is NNSA-level protection."

In the center of the room, Harrison Wells sat strapped to a chair, breathing hard through the gag. Mid-forties, expensive suit now rumpled, eyes wide with terror. Dr. Vasquez monitored his vitals, her expression clinical.

"His stress markers are genuine," Elena confirmed. "He's not faking. Whatever data he's protecting, it's locked tight."

Wells made a muffled sound that might have been pleading.

Zara checked her internal chronometer. Forty-two minutes since capture. They were running out of time.

The door opened. Mat Chang entered, his augmented frame moving with predatory grace, chrome fingers drumming against his thigh.

"Having trouble with the brick?" he asked, voice carrying amused condescension. "Should've called me first. All this soft-touch technical probing—waste of time."

"We're attempting non-destructive extraction," Kaia said carefully.

"Why?" Mat approached Wells, studying him like machinery. "Neural Cascade Override. Thirty seconds of targeted electromagnetic pulses, fry through the locks, dump everything to storage. Clean extraction."

"That kills the subject," Elena protested.

"Damages the hardware," Mat corrected. "Same result, more accurate terminology. But we get the data, which is what matters. Clock's ticking." He looked at Maya. "Give me access to your interface. I'll have this done in—"

"No."

Kyr4n's voice cut through the discussion. Zara hadn't heard him enter—he'd gotten disturbingly good at moving silently. He stood in the doorway, still wearing the compression shirt from their aborted training session hours ago.

"Mat, your method would work," Kyr4n continued, moving into the room. "But it destroys the asset. We need him functional for release."

"Release?" Mat laughed. "You're joking. We're on a deadline. He's seen our faces, knows our location—"

"Which is why he gets released to a public transit station within the hour, unharmed, with a plausible cover story about being drugged and robbed." Kyr4n's tone was flat, analytical. "A dead corporate executive triggers a murder investigation. A live one who can't remember specific details because of chemical amnesia? That's just Tuesday in the South Shore."

Mat's chrome fingers flexed. "You're wasting time with soft logistics when we could extract and dispose—"

"Black Box Protocol," Kyr4n interrupted, addressing the room. "Everyone out. Zero electromagnetic interference. That means all scanning equipment powered down, all augmented systems set to passive mode, all recording devices disabled."

Maya and Kaia exchanged glances. "Boss, we won't be able to monitor—"

"I know. Out. Now."

The technical team filed out, Mat following with obvious reluctance. Dr. Vasquez paused at the door. "If you need medical intervention—"

"I'll call."

Elena left. The heavy door sealed with a pneumatic hiss.

Zara stayed against her wall.

Kyr4n glanced at her. "That includes you."

"I'm your bodyguard," she said flatly. "I don't leave you alone with potentially hostile assets."

He considered this, then shrugged. "Stay. But be quiet, and don't interfere."

"What are you going to do?" Zara asked, studying the setup. Wells strapped to a chair, Kyr4n unarmed, no interrogation equipment visible. "Talk him into unlocking his own neural architecture?"

"Something like that." Kyr4n approached Wells slowly, hands visible, posture non-threatening. He removed the gag gently.

Wells gasped, working his jaw. "Please—I have a family. Two daughters. I'll pay whatever—"

"I know." Kyr4n pulled up a chair, sitting at eye level. "Hannah, age twelve. Rebecca, age nine. Hannah plays violin. Rebecca wants to be a marine biologist. Your wife Sarah teaches literature at the university."

Wells went pale. "How—"

"Because I needed to know who you are before I took you. Harrison Wells, Executive Director of Urban Infrastructure Planning. Forty-three years old. You've worked for NeoGen Corporation for sixteen years. You're good at your job. You love your family. You're terrified right now." Kyr4n's voice remained calm, matter-of-fact. "I'm not going to torture you."

"Then what—"

"I'm going to let you go home to them. Tonight. Unharmed. With a cover story about being mugged that your company will believe because it's embarrassingly common for corporate executives who venture into the South Shore without proper security."

Wells stared. "Why?"

"Because I need information you have, and I can get it without hurting you. But first—" Kyr4n began unbuckling the restraints. "—you need to stop being terrified."

Zara's hand moved toward her weapon. "Boss—"

"Quiet," Kyr4n said without looking at her. "Mr. Wells isn't going to do anything violent. Are you, Harrison?"

Wells shook his head rapidly as the last restraint released. He didn't run. Just sat there, rubbing his wrists.

"Good." Kyr4n stood, moving to a small bag Zara hadn't noticed before. He pulled out an old music player—actual physical device, pre-streaming era technology. "Do you dance, Harrison?"

Silence. Wells blinked. "What?"

"Dance. Do you know how?"

"I—yes. My wife and I took lessons for our anniversary. Ballroom, some swing. But I don't—"

"Good enough." Kyr4n connected the player to a small speaker, scrolling through a playlist.

Zara's jaw tightened. They had maybe forty minutes left before Wells' absence triggered corporate security protocols, and her boss was selecting music.

"This is insane," she muttered.

Kyr4n ignored her. Soft music began playing—downtempo, hypnotic, the kind of ambient electronic that belonged in expensive lounges, not concrete interrogation cells. The contrast was surreal.

"I don't understand," Wells said, genuine confusion replacing terror.

"Stand up," Kyr4n instructed gently. "We're going to dance."

"I don't—this doesn't make sense—"

"I know. But it's better than the alternative. Mat wanted to fry your neural architecture and sort through the wreckage. I'd prefer a gentler approach. So. Dance with me, Harrison. That's all I'm asking."

Wells stood slowly, looking at Zara as if she might explain. She had nothing to offer. This was the most tactically incomprehensible thing she'd witnessed in her entire career.

Kyr4n extended his hand.

After five seconds of hesitation, Wells took it.

## Kyr4n's POV

The moment Harrison's hand settled in his, Kyr4n felt the familiar tingling at the base of his skull—the nanobots spreading through his nervous system, extending microscopic threads through his skin, seeking contact points.

Not yet. Too fast would trigger panic.

He pulled Harrison closer, positioning them in a basic closed dance hold. The executive moved stiffly, uncertain, still confused by the lack of violence. His body radiated heat through the expensive suit fabric. Pulse rapid against Kyr4n's palm where their hands connected. The faint scent of fear-sweat mixing with expensive cologne.

"Just follow," Kyr4n said quietly. "Like you did with your wife."

They began moving. Slow rotation, gentle sway. Nothing complex. Harrison stumbled slightly, then found the rhythm. The music helped—predictable tempo, hypnotic progression. Kyr4n led with subtle pressure, body language Harrison's trained responses could interpret.

Three minutes of this. Just movement. Just presence. Letting Harrison's nervous system adapt to the contact, to the proximity, to the absence of threat.

The terror-tension in Harrison's shoulders began releasing. His breathing deepened. The music filled the spaces where fear had lived.

Kyr4n enjoyed this part. Not the extraction—that came later. This part. The connection. Two bodies finding synchronization. The heat between them. The slide of fabric against fabric. The way Harrison's hand gradually relaxed in his.

People thought interrogation required adversarial positioning. They were wrong. Adversarial created resistance. This—this created openness.

He pulled Harrison slightly closer. Close enough that their chests nearly touched, that Harrison could feel his breathing, that the last protective distance dissolved. The executive tensed briefly, then—surprising both of them—relaxed into it.

"That's good," Kyr4n murmured. "Just like that."

The nanobots extended now. Microscopic filaments crossing from his skin to Harrison's through their connected hands, their proximity. Sliding past dermal layers, finding neural pathways, following bioelectric signals up through his nervous system toward the locked data architecture in his brain.

Harrison shuddered slightly. "I feel—strange. Warm."

"That's normal. Keep moving."

The quantum-encrypted locks appeared in Kyr4n's awareness like crystalline structures—beautiful, complex, adaptive. The kind of security that would take conventional hackers years to crack. But conventional hackers weren't operating from inside the system, weren't using biological interfaces that the algorithms didn't recognize as threats because they mimicked Harrison's own neural activity.

The locks opened like flowers.

Data flooded through the connection. Infrastructure schematics. Meeting minutes. Financial transfers. Security schedules. Personnel files. Everything Harrison had access to, everything protected behind military-grade encryption, flowing through the nanobotic interface into Kyr4n's enhanced memory.

But he didn't focus on that. Focused on the dance. On the weight of Harrison's body against his. On the way the music shaped their movement. On the strange intimacy of this moment—two men moving together in a concrete cell, sharing something that felt almost sacred despite its pragmatic purpose.

Harrison's eyes had closed. His head rested slightly against Kyr4n's shoulder. Not from exhaustion—from surrender. Genuine release of control. The way his wife probably felt when they danced, safe and held and not having to think.

Kyr4n smiled. Not the cold smile of tactical success. A real one. This was beautiful. Not despite what he was doing, but including it. The extraction and the intimacy weren't separate. They were the same thing.

He felt no guilt. Why would he? Harrison would return to his family unharmed. The data Kyr4n needed would prevent larger violence. And this moment—this genuine connection, however temporary—that was real too. Harrison was enjoying this, even if he didn't understand why.

Fair exchange. Freedom and safety for data and intimacy. Both parties benefiting. Clean. Efficient. Pleasant.

The song reached its final progression. Kyr4n held the connection a moment longer than necessary, savoring the warmth, then gently stepped back as the music ended.

Harrison's eyes opened slowly, dazed. "What—what just happened?"

"We danced," Kyr4n said simply. "Thank you. That was beautiful."

"I feel—" Harrison touched his head. "Strange. Light. Did you drug me?"

"No drugs. Just music and movement." Kyr4n moved to the door, knocked once. "Marcus will take you to the transit station now. You were mugged, drugged with something that affects memory formation. You don't remember faces or locations. Just darkness and confusion. Then you woke up at the station. That's the story."

The door opened. Marcus entered, expression carefully neutral despite obvious questions.

"Get him home," Kyr4n said. "Quickly. Safely."

Harrison stood shakily. "I don't—I don't understand any of this."

"You don't need to." Kyr4n met his eyes. "You're going home to Hannah and Rebecca. Kiss them goodnight. Tell Sarah you love her. That's all that matters."

Marcus guided Harrison toward the exit. The executive looked back once, confusion and something else—gratitude, maybe—crossing his face. Then he was gone.

Kyr4n stood in the empty cell, feeling the data settling into his enhanced memory, organizing itself. Infrastructure vulnerabilities. Security gaps. Personnel with exploitable connections. Everything they needed for the next phase.

Forty-seven minutes from capture to release. Clean. Efficient. No permanent damage.

And genuinely enjoyable.

## Zara's POV

Zara watched Marcus lead Harrison Wells out, then rounded on Kyr4n.

"What the fuck just happened?"

"Successful extraction." Kyr4n gathered the music player, disconnecting it from the speaker. "Wells has been released with plausible deniability. No kidnapping investigation. No corporate manhunt. Clean operation."

"We just danced with him and let him go." Zara's voice carried barely controlled frustration. "We wasted eighteen minutes on a fucking _dance_ when we had less than an hour total. Did we get _anything_?"

"Everything we needed."

"How? I was watching the entire time. No tech. No neural interface. No interrogation. Just—" She gestured at the empty space where they'd been moving. "—whatever that was."

Kyr4n looked at her with that analytical calm that made her want to hit something. "You asked me to stay quiet and not interfere. You didn't ask me to explain."

"I'm asking now."

"And I'm declining to answer." He moved toward the door. "Debrief with Kaia in thirty minutes. She'll want the data."

"What data?" Zara followed him into the corridor. "You didn't extract anything. There was no connection, no interface, no—"

"There was," Kyr4n said simply. "You just couldn't see it."

He left her standing in the hallway, music player in hand, expression satisfied in a way that made her teeth grind.

Zara stood there for a full minute, processing.

The time pressure had been real. Mat's brutal method would have worked but killed Wells. Kyr4n's method had looked like insane time-wasting. But Wells was alive, released, and Kyr4n claimed successful extraction.

Either her boss had just wasted critical minutes dancing for no reason—which made him incompetent.

Or he'd extracted military-grade encrypted data through methods invisible to her enhanced senses and technical training—which made him something she couldn't properly categorize.

She thought about this morning's training session. The way he'd moved when genuinely threatened. The submission hold that had put her face-down on the mat. The casual dominance that appeared and disappeared like it was optional.

The way he'd said she wasn't a threat.

Now this. Eighteen minutes of dancing that somehow constituted successful interrogation. Time that should have been tactically disastrous but apparently produced results she couldn't detect.

What are you? she thought again.

And underneath the question, something else. The memory of watching that dance. The strange intimacy of it. The way Kyr4n had moved with genuine enjoyment, like the contact pleased him. The way Wells had surrendered, not from fear but from something that looked almost like trust.

Soft power. The kind she'd never learned. The kind that made violence unnecessary because it bypassed the need entirely.

She hated it. Hated not understanding. Hated that her training and augmentations made her excellent at breaking things but apparently blind to whatever Kyr4n had just done.

Hated that it worked.

Her comm buzzed. Marcus.

"Wells is on the transit. Sedated, confused, but unharmed. He'll wake up at home with the cover story intact."

"Acknowledged." She hesitated. "Marcus, what the hell did we just watch?"

Silence. Then: "The Boss doing what he does. You'll get used to it."

"That's not an answer."

"No," Marcus agreed. "But it's the only one I've got. See you at debrief."

The line went dead.

Zara stood in the empty corridor, arms crossed, tactical wetware processing insufficient data. Forty-seven minutes from capture to release. Zero violence. No visible technical extraction. One very confused corporate executive going home to his family.

And Kyr4n walking away with whatever data he'd obtained through methods she couldn't perceive.

She thought about Mat's neural cascade. Brutal. Efficient. Understandable. The kind of interrogation that made tactical sense—extract the data, accept the cost.

Kyr4n had rejected that. Used intimacy instead. Danced with the target like time pressure didn't exist. And somehow, impossibly, succeeded.

Soft power.

She'd spent her entire life becoming a weapon. Learning to break, to cut, to dominate through violence. It was a language she understood.

This wasn't that language.

This was something else entirely. Something she couldn't read, couldn't categorize, couldn't properly assess.

Something that worked without her understanding how.

She pushed off the wall, heading toward the debriefing room. Kaia would want data. Maya would want technical explanations. Mat would probably complain about wasted opportunities.

And Zara would sit there, watching them process intelligence extracted through invisible means, trying to understand what the fuck she'd actually witnessed.

Trying to understand what she was protecting.

The apex predator who could pin her to a mat without effort. The leader who danced with terrified hostages and called it interrogation. The baseline-appearing human who healed from injuries that should have hospitalized him, learned combat techniques overnight from reading, and apparently extracted military-grade encrypted data through physical proximity alone.

What are you?

The question echoed. Unanswered. Persistent.

And underneath it, another thought she didn't want to examine: the memory of this morning's submission hold. The feeling of being controlled, dominated, proved weaker.

The way watching that intimate dance had made her aware of power expressed through connection instead of violence.

The growing suspicion that she'd signed up to protect someone she didn't understand and couldn't properly assess.

Someone dangerous in ways she hadn't been trained to recognize.

Someone who made her training feel inadequate.

She hated it.

And part of her—the part that had responded to being pinned this morning with something other than professional analysis—was fascinated by it.

_Professional relationship,_ she reminded herself. _Employer and bodyguard. Nothing more._

The mantra felt weaker every time she repeated it.

Behind her, the detention cell stood empty except for the fading warmth of two bodies that had moved together, sharing something invisible that functioned as espionage.

The music player's battery had died. The speaker sat silent.

But the memory of what she'd witnessed—and failed to understand—followed her down the corridor like a question that refused to be ignored.
