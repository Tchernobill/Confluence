## The Scene

Isa paused at the threshold of what had once been their shared workshop, her hand resting on the doorframe as she took in the changes. The space had evolved—expanded, refined, but somehow felt smaller. Defensive modifications caught her trained eye: reinforced walls, subtle electromagnetic shielding, shadows that seemed to cling to corners with deliberate intent. The air hummed with a low-frequency vibration she remembered from their early days, but amplified, more complex.

She stepped inside the workshop with the careful reverence of someone entering a sacred space that might have become a shrine to something darker.

"Hey," she said simply.

Time crystallized around that single syllable. Vyr4n's hands stilled on the neural interface he'd been calibrating, his shoulders tensing in a way that spoke of recognition deeper than conscious thought. He didn't turn immediately—couldn't, perhaps—as if movement might shatter whatever fragile moment had just crystallized between them.

When he finally pivoted on his stool, their eyes met across five years of silence, and Isa felt her breath catch. He was the same person—lean frame, dark hair falling across angular features—but something fundamental had shifted. His gaze held depths that hadn't existed before, shadows that moved independently of the light.

"Isa." Her name emerged like a prayer he'd forgotten how to say.

"You've been busy." She gestured vaguely at the expanded workshop, the sophisticated equipment, the subtle aura of power that seemed to radiate from him like heat from circuitry under load.

He said nothing, just watched her with those changed eyes. The silence stretched between them, not uncomfortable exactly, but loaded with the weight of everything unsaid.

"Crazy, everything I hear about you all these years." She took a half-step closer, noting how he didn't retreat but didn't welcome the proximity either. "Sounds like you became some sort of legend out there."

Something flickered across his expression—pain, maybe, or the ghost of who he used to be. "I'm... I'm actually just going with the flow." His voice carried the same precise cadence she remembered, but quieter now, more careful. "How... have you been?"

The simple question hit harder than she'd expected. How had she been? Building Phoenix Recovery into something legitimate, filling days with productive work to avoid thinking about empty nights. Successful by any measure, except the one that mattered most.

"I'm keeping up," she said, surprised by the steadiness of her own voice. "Some ups, some downs, then more ups. Phoenix Recovery's doing well. Really well."

"I heard." The smallest smile ghosted across his lips. "Thirty-seven employees now. Legitimate contracts with three major corps. Impressive."

She blinked. "You've been keeping track."

"Of course I have." The admission seemed to surprise him as much as her. His fingers drummed against his workbench—an old nervous habit that sent an unexpected pang through her chest. "I never... I wanted to make sure you were safe. That what we built was thriving."

"What we built," she repeated softly. "Vyry..." She moved closer, close enough to see the faint pattern of lines beneath his skin that definitely hadn't been there before. "What happened to us? Between you and me? I left, but I didn't want to. So why—"

The question hung in the air like a suspended electrical charge. Vyr4n's hands clenched on the workbench, and for a moment the lights flickered—so briefly she might have imagined it.

"During the coma..." His voice emerged barely above a whisper. "The virus... it trapped me inside myself, with no way out. The nightmare was endless. Monsters would chase me down, tear me apart, rebuild me just to do it again."

Isa's hand rose involuntarily toward him, then stopped mid-air as he continued.

"And then you would appear." His eyes found hers, and she saw the old pain there, still raw after all these years. "I'd run toward you because you were always my last hope, my safe harbor. You'd shelter me in your arms, and for just a moment, I'd think I was saved."

She felt her throat constrict.

"Then your hands would grip my back, sink your fingers into me, and you'd rip me apart. Tear me into pieces. Again and again and always." His voice carried the mechanical precision he used when describing technical processes, as if clinical distance could somehow lessen the horror. "Each time, I'd still run toward you. You were always my last hope, even knowing what would come."

"Oh, Vyry..." The words escaped as barely a breath.

"Sometimes it was Sedh. He'd lure me with promises of safety, then rip my head off and turn me into some grotesque bio-organic sculpture. Mira would heal me just to watch me die slower." He paused, studying his hands as if they belonged to someone else. "I can't tell you how many years it lasted. Time moves differently in hell."

Isa found herself moving closer without conscious thought, drawn by the pain in his voice despite the horror of his words.

"One day, Sedh pulled me out. I woke up, opened my eyes, was back in the lab room." He looked up at her then, and she saw tears forming. "You were standing next to me, holding my hand. Just like you used to when I had bad dreams."

She remembered. Sitting by his bedside for weeks, talking to him, holding his hand, hoping some part of him could hear her voice through whatever hell the virus had created.

"Then you plunged your other hand into my chest and pulled out my heart. Gave it to Sedh, who started laughing." His voice cracked slightly. "It happened several times. False awakenings, each one more cruel than the last."

"But I didn't—" she started, then stopped as understanding hit her. "The real awakening."

"One day, you simply didn't. You didn't do anything bad to me, neither did Sedh or Mira. I just kept waiting for it—for the part where one of you would kill me." He wiped at his eyes with the back of his hand, the gesture so achingly familiar it made her chest tight. "Hours, days, weeks. I don't remember when I actually stopped waiting for the hurt. But when I did, you were already gone."

Quiet tears were tracking down her cheeks now. "I waited as long as I could. But you... you looked at me like I was the monster from your nightmares. Every time I touched you, you flinched. Every time I spoke, you tensed like you were expecting pain."

"I know." His voice was hollow. "I know that wasn't fair to you. I know you never hurt me, not really. But the virus... it had spent so long teaching me that everyone I loved would eventually destroy me. The lesson was burned too deep."

"So you pushed me away to protect me from you." It wasn't a question.

"No." He met her eyes directly. "I pushed you away to protect me from you. From the possibility that someday, the virus might be right."

The admission hung between them like a bridge neither was sure they could cross. Isa studied his face, noting the new lines around his eyes, the way his hands trembled almost imperceptibly. But also the familiar way he tilted his head when thinking, the precise way he chose his words.

"The person I hear about now," she said carefully, "the legend, the one people fear... is that who you became when you stopped trusting?"

"Partly." He looked down at his hands. "The virus gave me abilities I never wanted. Made me stronger, faster, able to interface with any electronic system. Made it easy to solve problems with force instead of patience." He paused. "Made it easy to stop caring about the collateral damage."

"And now?" She stepped closer, studying his face carefully. "Do you still see me as a threat?"

A different kind of smile crossed his features—darker, but strangely more peaceful. "No," he said quietly. "Now I'm the one chasing the threats in the nightmares. Corporate security forces, board members who think they can buy and sell people like components." His eyes met hers with an intensity that made her breath catch. "The virus taught me to be afraid of the people I loved. But it also gave me the tools to hunt the ones who actually deserve that fear."

Isa moved closer, close enough to touch if she wanted to. "That's not exactly reassuring."

Vyr4n was quiet for a long moment, studying her face as if seeing it for the first time in years. "Now? Looking at you now?" He shook his head slowly. "Now I see the person who taught me that intimacy didn't have to hurt. Who showed me that broken things could be fixed with patience instead of force." His voice dropped to almost a whisper. "I see the person I was too damaged to keep."

"You didn't lose me," she said softly. "You let me go because you thought it was the right thing to do. There's a difference."

"Is there?" He looked up at her, something like hope flickering in his eyes. "Because I've spent five years wondering if I made the biggest mistake of my life."

"Just five years?" She stepped closer, near enough now that she could see the faint electromagnetic shimmer around him, feel the subtle warmth he radiated. "I've been wondering that since the day I walked out."

"Isa..." Her name on his lips carried a weight of longing that made her chest ache.

"I know you're different now," she said, reaching up slowly to trace the barely visible patterns beneath the skin of his jaw. He didn't flinch away. "I know you've done things that would have horrified the person you were. I know people fear you."

"Doesn't that scare you?" His hand came up to cover hers where it rested against his face. "Knowing what I've become?"

"Terrify me," she admitted. "But not because of what you might do to me. Because of what the world might do to you." She felt his hand tighten over hers. "Because I can see in your eyes that you remember who you used to be, and that's a special kind of torture all by itself."

"Every day," he whispered.

"Then let me help carry it." She shifted closer, until she was standing between his knees as he sat on the stool. "Let me remind you that you're still the person who sees broken things and wants to fix them. Who believes everything deserves a second chance."

"Even me?"

"Especially you."

For a moment they just looked at each other, the weight of five years of separation and transformation hanging between them. Then Vyr4n's free hand came up to cup her face, his thumb brushing away the tear tracks on her cheek.

"I missed you," he said simply. "Every enhanced heartbeat, every amplified thought, every moment of clarity the virus gave me—I missed you through all of it."

"I missed you too," she whispered back. "The real you. The one who talks to machines while he works on them. Who sleeps curled up in small spaces because it feels safe. Who sees the potential in everything everyone else has given up on."

"I'm not that person anymore."

"No," she agreed. "You're that person plus everything you've survived since. And I want to know all of it. The good, the bad, the parts that scare you." She moved closer still, until their foreheads were almost touching. "If you'll let me."

"I don't know how to trust anymore," he admitted.

"Then don't trust me," she said. "Trust us. Trust what we built before, and what we might build now."

Something shifted in his expression—a careful kind of hope, like a system coming online after a long shutdown. "The debugging process might be complex."

Despite everything, she found herself smiling. "Good thing I've learned a lot about complex systems in the last five years."

When he kissed her, it was nothing like the passionate encounters of their youth. This was careful, questioning, a tentative query sent into the unknown. She responded with equal care, her lips soft against his, her hands steady on his face as if anchoring him to the present moment.

The kiss deepened slowly, years of separation and longing compressed into the simple contact. She tasted salt from tears—his or hers, she couldn't tell—and felt the slight electric tingle where their skin touched, a reminder of what he'd become mixed with the memory of who he'd been.

When they finally separated, he rested his forehead against hers, eyes closed, breathing unsteady.

"This might not work," he whispered. "I might hurt you again. I might—"

"Vyry." She waited until he opened his eyes. "I'm not the same person either. I've built a business, learned to fight, survived five years without you. I'm not the girl who needed protection from the riots."

"No," he agreed, studying her face as if memorizing it. "You're stronger now. More resilient." A small smile played at the corners of his mouth. "It's incredibly attractive."

She laughed—a real laugh, the first she'd had since walking into this room. "There's the technical analysis I remember."

"Some core processes never change," he said, and this time when he smiled, it reached his eyes. "Even with significant system modifications."

"Lucky for me," she said, and kissed him again—quicker this time, but no less meaningful. "So what now? Do we try to rebuild what we had, or do we build something entirely new?"

"Both," he said without hesitation. "We take the stable elements from the original design and integrate them with the enhanced capabilities we've both developed." He paused, his technical metaphor slipping into something more vulnerable. "If you're willing to take the risk of a complete system rebuild."

"With you?" She looked around the workshop that had once been theirs, now transformed into something more sophisticated but somehow incomplete without her presence in it. "I've been waiting five years for this conversation."

"The process might take time," he warned. "There will be bugs. Compatibility issues. Unexpected crashes."

"Then we'll debug them together," she said simply. "One iteration at a time."

When he kissed her the third time, there was no hesitation in it—just the careful certainty of two people choosing to build something new from the pieces of what they'd lost. Outside, the workshop hummed with the sound of systems running in harmony, and for the first time in five years, the space felt complete.
