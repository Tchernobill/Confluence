## Scene

The concrete chamber beneath their corporate district headquarters had been designed for exactly this purpose—soundproof walls, filtered air systems, and surveillance equipment that could be disabled when discretion was required. Corporate Executive Director Harrison Wells sat strapped to a reinforced chair, his expensive suit wrinkled from three days of unsuccessful interrogation attempts.

Kaia looked up from her tablet as heavy footsteps echoed down the metal stairs, her expression carrying the professional frustration of someone whose expertise had been proven insufficient. "Standard memory extraction protocols failed completely," she reported without preamble. "Corporate-grade neural locks, probably installed at board level. Maya's tried every decryption algorithm we have."

Maya stood hunched over a portable console, multiple cables connecting her equipment to neural interface ports on Wells' temples. "The encryption is military-grade," she said without looking up, fingers dancing across holographic displays. "Quantum-encrypted, self-modifying algorithms. I could crack it eventually, but it would take months and probably cause permanent brain damage."

Wells himself sat rigid in the chair, his earlier defiance slowly crumbling as he processed the identity of the figure approaching him. When recognition finally dawned, his face went pale as corporate-issue paper.

"The Slum Demon!" he whispered to himself, the words barely audible but carrying the weight of absolute terror.

Marcus stood near the door, his cybernetic arm whirring softly as servos adjusted to maintain perfect stillness. "Sir, he's been consistent for seventy-two hours. The neural locks appear to be hardwired rather than software-based. Physical removal would be... messy."

Dr. Elena Vasquez checked her medical readouts one final time. "Vitals are stable but elevated. Stress hormones indicate genuine terror, not performance. He's telling the truth about the locks—I can see the neural pathway disruptions on the brain scans."

The sound of lighter footsteps on the stairs announced another arrival. Mat Chang descended into the chamber, his electric blue hair catching the harsh fluorescent light as he surveyed the scene with detached curiosity. His fingerless gloves flexed as he approached Maya's setup, dark eyes scanning the data displays with the casual expertise of someone who breathed information systems.

"Still playing with the corporate toys, Maya?" Mat's voice carried its characteristic sardonic tone as he leaned over her shoulder to examine the decryption attempts. "Quantum encryption, recursive algorithms, self-modifying defense protocols... very pretty. Very slow."

Maya didn't look up from her work. "If you have a better idea, Wire, I'm all ears. This is military-grade protection."

Mat's lips curved into a dry smile as he straightened, glancing at Wells with the same clinical interest he might show a particularly corrupted data cluster. "Actually, I do. Neural cascade override. Direct interface breach through the primary cortical pathways. Bypass the encryption protocols entirely—go straight to the base memory allocation."

Wells' breathing became rapid and shallow. "What... what does that mean?"

"It means," Mat continued with characteristic bluntness, "I jack directly into your neural interface and brute-force the memory locks using raw processing cycles. Essentially, we overload the defensive algorithms until they collapse." He tilted his head, considering the technical challenge. "Clean data extraction, minimal processing time."

"And the side effects?" Dr. Vasquez asked, though her medical readouts already suggested the answer.

Mat's expression remained unchanged. "Catastrophic neural feedback. The defensive systems trigger full countermeasures to protect encrypted data. His cortex would essentially suffer cascading system failure." He pulled up a holographic display from his wrist interface, showing neural pathway diagrams. "Memory access window: approximately thirty seconds before total neural collapse. But complete data recovery—everything from mission parameters to his entire corporate knowledge base."

"No!" Wells lurched against his restraints, terror giving him strength. "Please, you can't! I have a family, children! The locks aren't my choice—the Board installed them when I reached executive level. I can't remove them even if I wanted to!"

Mat pulled a modified neural interface cable from his jacket, examining the connector with the same detached interest. "Information wants to be free, Mr. Wells. Sometimes the price is just higher than we'd prefer." His dark eyes met the executive's panicked gaze. "Besides, thirty seconds of raw memory access would give us everything—not just the mission parameters, but your entire corporate database, security protocols, executive communications. It's actually the most efficient solution."

"Let me try!" Mat stepped forward, his voice taking on the enthusiastic edge it carried when he encountered an interesting technical challenge. "Maya's approach is too conservative. She's trying to preserve the integrity of his neural pathways, but that's what's making this take so long. If we accept some acceptable losses—"

"Mat, no." Maya's voice was sharp. "We're not talking about corrupted data files. We're talking about a human brain."

"A human brain that contains the data architecture we need," Mat replied with characteristic bluntness. "The risk-benefit analysis is straightforward. One corporate asset versus intelligence that could optimize survival parameters for hundreds of slum residents." He connected his neural interface cable to his jack, the other end poised near Wells' trembling head. "Sometimes you have to accept data loss to prevent system-wide failure."

Wells pressed himself back into the chair as far as the restraints allowed, his breathing rapid and shallow. "Please," he whispered. "Don't..."

The sound of deliberate footsteps on the metal stairs cut through the tension. Vyr4n descended into the chamber, his presence immediately commanding the attention of everyone present. His eyes took in the scene—Mat with the neural cable, Wells' terror, Maya's frustrated equipment setup—and his expression remained unreadable.

"Everyone out please, I'd like to be alone with Mr. Wells." Vyr4n said quietly. "Also, apply the Black Box protocol for the room. I want zero electromagnetic interference."

The room began to clear with efficient professionalism. Maya powered down her equipment, Kaia secured her files, Dr. Tremblay gathered her medical sensors. Marcus approached Vyr4n.

Mat straightened, his expression shifting to mild annoyance. "Boss, I was just about to—"

"Out. Mat."

Mat disconnected his cable with visible reluctance, muttering under his breath about "inefficient algorithms" and "excessive concern for data source preservation." Maya began powering down her equipment, shooting Vyr4n a look that mixed relief with professional frustration. 



Vyr4n knelt beside the chair, bringing himself to eye level with the terrified executive. His movements were slow, deliberate, like approaching a wounded animal.
"Mr. Wells," he said softly, his voice carrying none of the menace the man clearly expected. "Look at me."

Wells' eyes met his reluctantly, searching for the legendary cruelty and finding only tired compassion.

As the others filed through the doorway, Zara didn't moved from her position against the wall. Her hand rested casually on her hip, dark eyes fixed on Wells with predatory interest.

"I stay," she said simply, her voice carried absolute certainty. "This is not negotiable."

Vyr4n studied her stubborn face, there was something beneath—a curiosity that carried darker undertones. She wanted to see what he could do. What he would do. He's have to be discreet.

"Fine. But you stay back, and you stay quiet."

"Understood."

The heavy door sealed with a mechanical lock. Vyr4n waited until all systems showed green, ensuring they existed in a perfect bubble of privacy, before approaching the corporate executive.

Wells pressed himself back into the chair as far as the restraints allowed, his breathing rapid and shallow. "Please," he whispered. "Don't..."

"I know." Vyr4n moved closer, his footsteps silent on the concrete floor.

"You know I can't help you." Wells' voice cracked with desperate hope. "Even if you... even if you do... whatever it is you do to people, the neural locks won't allow you in, it will just fry my brain."

Vyr4n knelt beside the chair, bringing himself to eye level with the terrified executive. His movements were slow, deliberate, like approaching a wounded animal.

"Mr. Wells," he said softly, his voice carrying none of the menace the man clearly expected. "Look at me."

Wells' eyes met his reluctantly, searching for the legendary cruelty and finding only tired compassion.

"No harm will come to you," Vyr4n continued. "Physical or mental. No pain or tortured. I give you my word."

"I... I don't understand." Wells blinked rapidly, confusion replacing some of his terror. "If you can't break the locks, and you won't hurt me..."

"We tried to decrypt and break in, and we failed. Simply. Sometime, one must recognize defeat." Vyr4n reached forward slowly, his hands moving toward the restraints with obvious intent. "Your ordeal is almost over."

From her position against the wall, Zara watched with growing fascination. She had expected traditional interrogation—pain, fear, the systematic breaking of will through precisely applied suffering. Instead, Vyr4n was... freeing the prisoner? He was going for the psychological route.

The restraints clicked open with soft metallic sounds. Wells rubbed his wrists, staring at Vyr4n with bewildered suspicion.

"Stand up," Vyr4n said gently.

"What?"

"Please. Stand up."

Wells rose unsteadily, his legs trembling from hours of confinement. Vyr4n stepped back, giving him space, then reached into his jacket and withdrew a small device—a portable music player that looked ancient by current standards.

Zara's muscles tensed. _Here it comes,_ she thought. _Psychological disorientation. Make them comfortable, then introduce the unexpected element. Classic disorientation technique._

"Do you dance, Mr. Wells?"

"I... what?" The executive's confusion was complete now, his mind unable to process this development.

Vyr4n set the player on a nearby surface, the pulsing beat creating an unexpectedly intimate ambiance in the brutal concrete space.

The opening notes began to fill the chamber—a hypnotic electronic rhythm layered with atmospheric synthesizers and haunting vocals that seemed to drift from another world. The music was downtempo, sensual, with a trip-hop foundation that created an almost narcotic atmosphere. It was the kind of sound that belonged in intimate spaces, designed to lower inhibitions and create emotional vulnerability.

"It's a simple question." Vyr4n stepped closer, extending his hand in a gesture that was unmistakably an invitation. "Do you dance?"

"I... my wife and I... sometimes..."

"Good." Vyr4n's hand remained extended, waiting. "Then you know how to follow a lead."

Wells stared at the offered hand as if it might be a weapon. Around them, the music continued its hypnotic progression, sensual and compelling in a way that seemed to bypass conscious thought.

_What the hell is he doing?_ Zara thought, her mind racing through possibilities. _Disorientation through absurdity? Psychological breakdown through confusion?_

"I don't understand what you want," Wells whispered.

"I want to dance," Vyr4n replied simply. "With you. Here. Now."

"This is insane."

"Probably." A slight smile crossed Vyr4n's features. "But it will set you free. Please, Mr. Wells. Take my hand."

The executive looked around the room as if seeking escape or explanation, his gaze briefly meeting Zara's. She kept her expression neutral, though internally she was screaming questions. Every instinct told her this was setup for something devastating—the calm before the storm.

Finally, with the desperate compliance of someone with no other options, Wells reached out and took Vyr4n's hand.

What happened next defied every expectation Zara had developed about interrogation.

Vyr4n pulled Wells close—closer than any conventional dance would require. Their bodies pressed together as he began to sway to the hypnotic rhythm, one hand holding Wells' while the other settled possessively on the small of his back. The movement was fluid, sensual, as if they were lovers sharing an intimate moment rather than captor and prisoner.

Wells stumbled at first, his corporate shoes slipping on the concrete floor, but Vyr4n's lead was strong and commanding. The music seemed to weave around them, its ethereal atmosphere creating a pocket of unreality in the harsh underground space.

They moved together in a way that transcended simple dancing. Vyr4n led with his entire body, guiding Wells through slow, hypnotic movements that brought them into constant physical contact. Hip against hip, chest against chest, their breathing gradually synchronizing as the rhythm took hold.

The corporate executive's resistance melted under the unexpected intimacy. His body relaxed against Vyr4n's, drawn into the seductive spell of movement and music. The downtempo beat seemed to pulse through both of them, creating a shared experience that was almost transcendent.

Zara watched with growing fascination and discomfort. This wasn't interrogation—it was seduction. The way Vyr4n held Wells, guided him, moved with him... it was arousing in a way that made her shift uncomfortably against the wall. The two men swayed together with increasing intimacy, their bodies telling a story of surrender and acceptance that bypassed all conscious resistance.

Wells' head fell back slightly as Vyr4n spun him in a slow turn, his eyes closing as he gave himself over to the experience. When Vyr4n drew him back, their faces were inches apart, breathing the same air in the close confines of their embrace.

_Where's the torture?_ Zara thought desperately. _Where's the shock? The pain? The breaking point?_

But Wells wasn't breaking. He was melting. His armor dissolved under the unexpected beauty of the moment, his fear replaced by something approaching bliss. They danced as if they were the only two people in the world, the music creating an intimate cocoon around their swaying forms.

Vyr4n's hands moved with careful intention—one maintaining the dance hold, the other tracing subtle patterns along Wells' spine that made the executive's breathing deepen. Their movement became more languid, more sensual, until it resembled a vertical expression of horizontal desires.

The music began to wind toward its conclusion, the ethereal vocals fading into whispered echoes. Vyr4n guided Wells through a final, intimate turn, then held him close as the last notes dissolved into silence.

For a moment they remained pressed together, breathing heavily in the sudden quiet. Then Vyr4n stepped back, his hands lingering on Wells' arms for just a heartbeat longer than necessary.

"Thank you," Vyr4n said softly, his voice carrying genuine warmth. "That was beautiful."

Wells stood swaying slightly, not from the dance but from emotional whiplash. His face was flushed, his breathing unsteady, his eyes holding a dazed quality that spoke of profound disorientation.

"I... I don't understand what just happened."

"We shared something beautiful." Vyr4n moved to turn off the music player.

"But why? What was the point?"

"The beauty of the moment Mr. Wells, now, as promised, you've earn your freedom. I will arrange your transport to the Saint-Hub station where you can hop on a tram and rejoin your family."

When he banged on the metal door, Marcus unlocked it and entered the room.

"Marcus, we are releasing Mr. Wells, please take him to Saint-Hub and make sure he hop on a tram safely"
