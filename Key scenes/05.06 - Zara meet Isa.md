# The Face from Nightmares

_Abandoned Phoenix Recovery Facility - South Shore Slum - Two years after mind connection_

Zara's hand moved instinctively toward her concealed blade as the cloaked figure entered the hangar bay. Professional paranoia was automatic—unknown contacts during retrieval operations meant potential complications, and complications meant someone might die.

"Contact, northeast entrance," she murmured into her comm, tracking the figure's movement while maintaining her position near the component crates.

The figure moved with confidence rather than stealth, suggesting familiarity with the facility rather than hostile intent. Still, Zara kept her weapon accessible while the others—Marcus's team members—shifted into loose defensive positions.

Sedh, however, stepped forward with what could only be described as eager anticipation.

"Isa?" His voice carried hope and disbelief in equal measure.

The figure paused, then reached up to lower her hood, revealing a face that hit Zara like a physical blow to the chest.

*Dark brown hair with subtle red highlights. Hazel eyes with gold flecks. The gentle curve of her jawline. The way she tilted her head slightly when uncertain.*

Zara's breath caught as two years of carefully compartmentalized memories suddenly aligned. This was the face from Vyry4n's nightmares—the woman who had represented both salvation and betrayal, safety and terror. The one whose gentle hands had offered comfort before driving surgical instruments deep into his chest.

But this wasn't the nightmare version. This was real—warm, breathing, human. The woman Vyry4n still loved with an intensity that Zara had felt echoing through their neural connection, a love so deep and complicated that it had survived years of separation and virus-induced trauma.

"Sedh!" Isa's face lit up with genuine joy as she recognized the android. "Allah, it's really you. I wasn't sure if..."

She moved toward him, and Sedh opened his arms in welcome, embracing her with the careful affection of someone greeting cherished family. Zara watched the reunion with growing internal tension, her training warring with the cascade of emotions triggered by finally seeing this face in person.

*She's smaller than I expected,* was her first coherent thought. *More real. Less mythic.*

"I hoped I might find you here," Isa was saying, her voice carrying the slight street accent Zara remembered from the nightmares but warmer, more genuine. "When I heard there was activity at the old Phoenix site, I thought maybe..."

"He's not here," Sedh said gently, understanding immediately who she meant. "But Isa, there's so much I need to tell you. So much has changed."

Zara forced herself to remain in position, maintaining professional alertness while her mind raced. This woman had no idea she was being observed by someone who knew her face better than her own reflection, someone who had experienced her love and betrayal from the inside of Vyry4n's tortured psyche.

"Is he..." Isa's voice carried careful hope mixed with deep uncertainty. "Is he well? Safe?"

"He's... powerful now. Very powerful. But safe, yes." Sedh's expression grew thoughtful. "I think he would want to see you."

*He would,* Zara thought, remembering the phantom ache that crossed Vyry4n's features whenever something reminded him of his lost love. *He would want to see her so much it would probably kill him.*

"Marcus," she said quietly into her comm, needing to focus on immediate tactical concerns. "Status on the retrieval?"

"Ninety percent complete," came the reply. "Five minutes to finish loading."

Isa noticed the communication, her attention shifting to take in the operation around her with the observant eyes of someone accustomed to evaluating potentially dangerous situations.

"I'm sorry," she said, looking at Sedh with sudden concern. "I didn't mean to interrupt... whatever this is. I can wait, or come back..."

"No!" Sedh's response was immediate and emphatic. "No, this is perfect timing. We're finishing up here, and then..." He paused, something like excitement flickering across his features. "Isa, would you come with us? I could arrange for you to see him."

Zara felt her heart rate spike. The idea of bringing Isa directly to Vyry4n, without warning, without preparation, after years of separation and unresolved trauma...

*This could destroy him,* she thought. *Or heal him. Possibly both.*

"I..." Isa hesitated, uncertainty warring with obvious longing. "I don't know if that's wise. We didn't part well. I left when he needed me, and I'm not sure he'd want..."

"He would," Sedh said with absolute certainty. "Trust me on this. He would very much want to see you."

Zara watched Isa's face as she processed this information, seeing hope and fear in equal measure. This was the woman who had taught Vyry4n that intimacy didn't have to hurt, who had shown him that broken things could be fixed with patience instead of force. The woman whose phantom betrayal still haunted his dreams but whose real love had shaped everything good about who he'd become.

*She doesn't know about the nightmares,* Zara realized. *She has no idea what the virus did to his memories of her. She's probably been carrying guilt about leaving him when he was sick.*

"Ma'am?" One of Marcus's team members approached Zara. "Component retrieval is complete. Ready to move out on your signal."

Zara nodded, then made a decision that went against every tactical instinct she possessed.

"Sedh," she called out, drawing both his and Isa's attention. "Transport capacity?"

"Sufficient for an additional passenger," Sedh replied, understanding her question immediately.

Isa looked between them with growing confusion. "I'm sorry, I don't think we've been introduced..."

*You have no idea,* Zara thought, then adopted her most neutral professional tone. "Zara. Security chief for this operation." She paused, then made what felt like the most dangerous offer of her life. "You're welcome to accompany us if Sedh vouches for you."

"I vouch for her completely," Sedh said immediately. "Isa, this is exactly what should happen. You need to see each other."

Isa studied Zara's face with the observant intelligence that had made her successful in the underground economy. Zara forced herself to meet that gaze calmly, giving away nothing of the storm of recognition and complicated emotions churning beneath her professional exterior.

"You're sure it won't be... problematic?" Isa asked, clearly sensing undercurrents she couldn't identify.

*It will be the most problematic thing that's happened to any of us in years,* Zara thought. *But it's also probably necessary.*

"It's your choice," she said aloud. "But the offer stands."

Isa looked at Sedh, who nodded encouragingly, then back at Zara. Something in her expression suggested she was weighing factors beyond simple reunion logistics.

"All right," she said finally. "Yes. I'd like to see him."

*God help us all,* Zara thought, then keyed her comm. "All teams, prepare for departure. We have an additional passenger."

As they prepared to leave the abandoned Phoenix Recovery facility, Zara found herself watching Isa with fascination and growing dread. This woman represented everything Vyry4n had lost, everything he still longed for despite the complications their relationship would bring to his current life.

And Zara was about to deliver her directly to him, knowing it would change everything between them—possibly forever.

*He's going to be surprised,* she thought with dark humor. *And then he's going to be terrified. And then...*

She had no idea what would happen then. But as she watched Isa settle into the transport with the careful grace of someone accustomed to adapting to unexpected situations, Zara knew she was about to find out exactly how much Vyry4n's past could reshape his present.

The only question was whether any of them would survive the reunion intact.
