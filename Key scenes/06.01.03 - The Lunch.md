## The Events

- Lunch with multiple members of Vyr4n's inner circle
- Isa is reminiscent of the early days she met Vyr4n
- She mention the close call with the Enforcer at the market
- Vyr4n laugh and mention that Robert (the enforcer) is now a security patrol in the northen sector
- Isa is shocked that someone that tried to kill Vyr4n is working for his organisation
- Vyr4n explain that someday, that enforcer showed up, they talked, patched things up while Vyr4n was fixing his armor leg
- Vyr4n then mention that there is about 15 individuals that tried that kill him currently working in the organisation, 5 of them are even at this table
- Isa tell Vyr4n that he is insane, and that he could probably make it 6 now
- When everyone is puzzled, Isa explain that one of the lesser faction of the Citadel hired her to assassinate Vyr4n
- While everyone was shocked by the bomb revelation, Vyr4n took another bite of his sandwich
- Marcus face freeze, some feel awkward, Zara started to silently move closer behind Isa, hand on her weapon
- Dr Helene asked Isa if she was joking to which Isa casually confirmed it's true
- Vyr4n, swallowing his bite, amused, ask her how would she do it?
- Isa reply that she would first try to get re-introduced in his life, maybe through a contact, she'd get closer to him until he is comfortable with her presence, then she'd start making him bad coffee (describing exactly how she came back in his life)
- Vyr4n burst in laughter, most of those at the table had never heard him laugh, he declare that her plan could actually work! Only, she's have to manage to get her coffee worst than Ol'Tom's Brewed stuff from the Marker
- Isa admit that would be a serious challenge as Tom's brewery had more in common with used motor oil than anything drinkable
- Helene do press Isa for more details.
- Isa explain that Nordem, the Citadel leading faction, is planning something drastic to get rid of Vyr4n and bring back the Slum to it's low position, something like mass purge or something, but it so scary than most Citadel lower factions are desperate for an emergency plan that would fix the problem before Nordem act
- Isa mention the rumor that Nordem is aquiring a medium yield nuke and it could be linked
- Vyr4n then say that maybe they need to put Operation Snowfall in higher gear, giving Helene goosebumps
