# Arc 5 - The Interrogation

The concrete chamber beneath their corporate district headquarters had been designed for exactly this purpose—soundproof walls, filtered air systems, and surveillance equipment that could be disabled when discretion was required. Corporate Executive Director Harrison Wells sat strapped to a reinforced chair, his expensive suit wrinkled from three days of unsuccessful interrogation attempts.

[[Kaia]] looked up from her tablet as [[Vyry4n]] descended the metal stairs, her expression carrying the professional frustration of someone whose expertise had been proven insufficient. "Standard memory extraction protocols failed completely," she reported without preamble. "Corporate-grade neural locks, probably installed at board level. Maya's tried every decryption algorithm we have."

[[Maya]] stood hunched over a portable console, multiple cables connecting her equipment to neural interface ports on Wells' temples. "The encryption is military-grade," she said without looking up, fingers dancing across holographic displays. "Quantum-encrypted, self-modifying algorithms. I could crack it eventually, but it would take months and probably cause permanent brain damage."

Wells himself sat rigid in the chair, his earlier defiance replaced by poorly concealed terror as Vyry4n entered his field of vision. The executive's eyes tracked every movement, pupils dilated with the particular fear reserved for legends that had proven themselves real.

"I've heard the stories," Wells whispered, his voice hoarse from hours of refusing to speak. "The Technomancer. The one who turns people into puppets." His breathing became rapid and shallow. "I won't tell you anything. The corporate locks won't let me, even if I wanted to."

[[Marcus]] stood near the door, his cybernetic arm whirring softly as servos adjusted to maintain perfect stillness. "Sir, he's been consistent for seventy-two hours. The neural locks appear to be hardwired rather than software-based. Physical removal would be... messy."

[[Dr. Helene Tremblay]] checked her medical readouts one final time. "Vitals are stable but elevated. Stress hormones indicate genuine terror, not performance. He's telling the truth about the locks—I can see the neural pathway disruptions on the brain scans."

Vyry4n studied the man for a long moment, taking in the expensive chronometer, the manicured fingernails, the soft flesh of someone who had never known genuine hardship. A corporate prince brought low, trapped between his fear of consequence and his inability to comply.

"Everyone out," Vyry4n said quietly.

The room began to clear with efficient professionalism. Maya powered down her equipment, Kaia secured her files, Dr. Tremblay gathered her medical sensors. Marcus lingered near the door, protective instincts warring with obedience.

"Sir, are you certain—"

"Out, Marcus."

As the others filed through the doorway, [[Zara]] stepped forward from her position against the wall. Her hand rested casually on the grip of her concealed blade, dark eyes fixed on Wells with predatory interest.

"I stay," she said simply.

"Flame—"

"No." Her voice carried absolute certainty. "This is not negotiable. Your safety requires my presence."

Vyry4n studied her face, reading the subtle signs he'd learned to interpret over months of partnership. Concern for his wellbeing, yes, but something else beneath—a curiosity that carried darker undertones. She wanted to see what he could do. What he would do.

"Fine. But you stay back, and you stay quiet."

The heavy door sealed with an electromagnetic lock that would prevent any recording equipment from functioning. Vyry4n waited until the ventilation system cycled, ensuring complete acoustic isolation, before approaching the corporate executive.

Wells pressed himself back into the chair as far as the restraints allowed. "Please," he whispered. "I can't tell you anything. The locks will trigger, they'll turn my brain into soup. My wife, my children—they have hostages."

"I know." Vyry4n moved closer, his footsteps silent on the concrete floor. "The Board uses family leverage for executive insurance. Standard protocol for sensitive information containment."

"Then you know I can't help you." Wells' voice cracked with desperate hope. "Even if you torture me, even if you threaten my life, the neural locks won't allow information transfer. You'll have to let me go."

Vyry4n knelt beside the chair, bringing himself to eye level with the terrified executive. His movements were slow, deliberate, like approaching a wounded animal.

"Mr. Wells," he said softly, his voice carrying none of the menace the man clearly expected. "Look at me."

Wells' eyes met his reluctantly, searching for sadism or cruelty and finding only tired compassion.

"No harm will come to you," Vyry4n continued. "Physical or mental. You will not be tortured, not be broken, not be changed in any way that diminishes who you are. I give you my word."

"I... I don't understand." Wells blinked rapidly, confusion replacing some of his terror. "If you can't break the locks, and you won't hurt me..."

"Who said I couldn't break the locks?" Vyry4n reached up slowly, his hands moving toward Wells' face with obvious intent. "I said no harm would come to you. Those aren't the same thing."

Wells tried to pull away, but the restraints held him in place. "What are you doing? What—"

"Shh." Vyry4n's hands settled gently on either side of Wells' head, fingers spread across temples and cheekbones with the tenderness of a benediction. "Close your eyes. This will be easier if you don't fight it."

From her position against the wall, Zara watched with intense focus. She had expected violence, interrogation techniques honed through pain and fear. Instead, Vyry4n appeared to be offering comfort to a man who deserved none.

Wells' breathing slowed as seconds stretched into minutes. Vyry4n remained perfectly still, his hands warm against the executive's skin, his own breathing synchronized to match his subject's rhythm. Both men seemed to enter a meditative state, the only sound in the chamber the soft hum of air filtration systems.

Five minutes passed. Ten. Fifteen.

Wells' body gradually relaxed until he appeared to be sleeping peacefully. Vyry4n's concentration never wavered, his hands maintaining gentle contact while his face showed the subtle strain of intense mental effort.

After exactly seventeen minutes, Wells stirred naturally, blinking in confusion as consciousness returned.

"What..." He tested his restraints, seeming surprised to find himself unharmed. "Did I fall asleep? I remember you putting your hands on my face, and then..."

"You fainted," Vyry4n said simply, stepping back from the chair. "Fear response. Perfectly normal under the circumstances."

"That's it? You're not going to interrogate me?"

"No need." Vyry4n moved toward the door, his expression revealing nothing. "Marcus will arrange your return to corporate territory within the hour. You'll be delivered to the same location where you were taken."

"I don't understand." Wells' voice carried bewildered relief. "You kidnapped a Board executive for nothing? This makes no sense."

Vyry4n paused at the door, looking back with something that might have been pity. "Mr. Wells, in six hours your own security forces are going to attempt to eliminate you. They believe you've been compromised by your capture. The kill order specifies making it look like a mugging gone wrong near the Meridian Building. I suggest you disappear before then."

The color drained from Wells' face as corporate paranoia confirmed the truth of Vyry4n's impossibly specific knowledge. "But the neural locks... I couldn't have told you anything even if I wanted to..."

"No," Vyry4n agreed. "You couldn't have. Sleep well, Mr. Wells."

In the corridor outside, Zara walked beside Vyry4n in silence, her predatory instincts trying to process what she had just witnessed. Or rather, what she hadn't witnessed.

"That was..." she began, then stopped, searching for words. "What exactly was that?"

Vyry4n continued walking without response.

"You touched his face for seventeen minutes," she continued, her voice carrying the careful neutrality of someone probing for information. "He fell unconscious. Then you released him without asking a single question." She paused. "Either this was the most elaborate psychological manipulation I've ever seen, or..."

"Or?"

"Or you got what you needed." Her eyes narrowed as she studied his profile. "The way you told him about the corporate assassination attempt—you knew specific details. The Meridian Building, the fake mugging scenario. Details we didn't have before."

They reached the elevator, and Vyry4n pressed the call button without confirming or denying her assessment.

"The neural locks," Zara pressed. "Maya said they were unbreakable. Corporate grade, quantum encrypted. But somehow, in seventeen minutes of... what? Meditation? You bypassed security that should have taken months to crack."

The elevator doors opened with a soft chime.

"How?" she asked simply.

Vyry4n stepped into the elevator, and she followed, her questions hanging in the air between them. As the doors closed, he finally spoke.

"Corporate executives don't faint from fear," he said quietly. "Wells has been through stress conditioning, psychological resistance training. Fear alone wouldn't have rendered him unconscious."

"So what did?"

"His brain was occupied with other processes."

Zara felt a chill that had nothing to do with the elevator's air conditioning. "Occupied how?"

"You said you wanted to stay and observe. You observed." His eyes met hers in the elevator's polished surface. "What conclusions did you draw?"

She replayed the scene in her mind—Vyry4n's perfect stillness, Wells' gradual relaxation from terror to unconsciousness, the way Vyry4n had known specific details about corporate operations that hadn't been in their intelligence reports.

"You didn't break the neural locks," she said slowly. "You went around them."

"Accurate assessment."

"But that's impossible. Neural locks monitor electrical patterns throughout the entire brain. There's no way to access protected memories without triggering—" She stopped, understanding dawning. "Unless you weren't using the brain's natural electrical systems."

Vyry4n remained silent, but his lack of denial was confirmation enough.

"The virus," she whispered. "It's not just enhancing you anymore. It's giving you abilities that..." She swallowed hard. "What exactly are you becoming?"

The elevator reached their floor, but neither moved to exit when the doors opened.

"Someone who can protect the people I care about," Vyry4n said finally. "By any means necessary."

Zara stared at him, processing the implications. She had watched him sit motionless for seventeen minutes and somehow extract information from a man whose mind was protected by unbreakable corporate security. No torture, no coercion, no visible technique at all.

"Explain it to me," she said. "In simple terms. What did you actually do to him?"

Vyry4n was quiet for a long moment, then pressed the button to close the elevator doors, sealing them in privacy.

"The virus isn't just nanobots in my bloodstream anymore," he said finally. "It's become part of my nervous system. Part of me. I can deploy microscopic machines through skin contact—smaller than viruses, invisible to the naked eye."

"Machines that do what?"

"They mapped his neural pathways. Read his memories directly from brain tissue. The neural locks monitor electrical signals, but they can't detect machines that interface with individual synapses." His voice carried the clinical precision he used when explaining technical processes. "I literally read his thoughts while he slept."

The elevator hummed around them as Zara processed this information. Most people would have recoiled in horror. Zara's pupils dilated with fascination.

"You can send invisible machines into someone's brain," she said slowly. "Read their memories. Access their thoughts. All through simple touch."

"Yes."

"Without them knowing."

"Without them knowing."

"Without leaving any trace."

"Without leaving any trace."

The predatory smile that crossed her face would have terrified most people. On Zara, it looked like recognition—the expression of an apex predator acknowledging something even more dangerous than herself.

"I want to try it," she said simply.

Vyry4n stared at her. "Zara—"

"No, listen." She stepped closer, invading his personal space with characteristic boldness. "I've spent my life studying power in all its forms. Physical strength, psychological manipulation, the precise application of pain to achieve specific results." Her eyes held his with unwavering intensity. "But what you just described... that's ultimate power. Complete access to another person's mind."

"It's a violation—"

"Everything I do professionally is a violation." She laughed, a sound like silk sliding over steel. "I've broken minds through pain and fear, carved confessions from flesh with artistic precision. But what you did... that's something else entirely. Violation without violence, complete conquest without the victim even knowing they've been defeated."

Her hand rose to trace the air near his temple, not quite touching but close enough for him to feel the heat of her skin.

"I want to know what it feels like," she whispered. "To have someone that powerful inside my mind. To be that completely vulnerable and never realize it."

"Most people would find that terrifying."

"Most people haven't made a career out of exploring the boundaries between pleasure and pain, trust and betrayal." Her fingertips finally made contact, brushing his cheek with deadly gentleness. "I've always been attracted to dangerous things, Vyry4n. You've just redefined what danger means."

"You're asking me to violate your mind for your entertainment."

"I'm asking you to show me something I've never experienced before." Her voice dropped to an intimate purr. "Complete powerlessness. Total vulnerability. The ultimate submission to someone I trust absolutely."

The elevator waited around them, a small private world where impossible conversations could happen.

"You don't know what you're asking," Vyry4n said quietly.

"Don't I?" She moved closer still, until they were sharing breath in the confined space. "I know exactly what I'm asking. The question is whether you have the courage to say yes."

Her eyes held his, dark and challenging and completely unafraid. In the space between them lived the promise of trust so complete it bordered on madness, and the recognition that some hungers could only be fed by surrendering everything.
