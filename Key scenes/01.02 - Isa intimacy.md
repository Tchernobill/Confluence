# The Riot Night - Technical Intimacy

_South Shore Slum - Vyry4n's Ventilation Shaft - Day 2 of riots_

The concrete walls trembled with each distant explosion, orange light flickering through the narrow grate that served as Vyry4n's only window to the chaos above. For two days now, the South Shore Slum had been burning—what started as routine corporate intimidation had exploded into full-scale urban warfare when someone threw a homemade EMP grenade at a security mech.

Vyry4n sat hunched at his workbench, methodically organizing components while trying to ignore the woman resting in the corner of his cramped sanctuary. Isa had been here since he'd found her bleeding in an alley, and her presence filled the tiny space in ways that made his skin prickle with unfamiliar awareness.

The damaged memory implant she'd brought him sat in its protective case beside his tools—military-grade encryption, severe physical trauma, the kind of data recovery job that most techs would declare impossible. Exactly the sort of challenge that usually helped him forget everything else.

"Might as well make use of the time," he murmured, more to himself than to her.

He began setting up his precision repair station, the sealed chamber no larger than a toolbox that represented months of scavenged components and careful engineering. As he connected hair-thin lines to gas cylinders and monitoring equipment, the familiar ritual of preparation helped steady his nerves.

"What is that thing?" Isa asked from her corner, watching him work with obvious curiosity.

Vyry4n glanced up, surprised by her interest. Most people saw his equipment as incomprehensible tech magic.

"Molecular-level repair chamber," he said, continuing his setup. "Creates an inert atmosphere, uses micro-robotic arms for precision work. This implant—" he gestured toward her damaged memory unit, "—has physical damage down to the component level. Standard tools would just make it worse."

Isa shifted closer, careful not to crowd him in the limited space. "And you can fix something that badly damaged?"

"Maybe. Depends on how much the important pathways survived." He connected his neural interface to the control system, the familiar weight of the wrist-mounted device feeling reassuring. "I'll need to interface directly with the chamber, work at near-molecular precision. Could take hours."

"Interface directly?"

He held up his wrist, showing the neural connection port. "Think of it as... very precise remote control. My thoughts control the micro-robots inside the chamber."

Her eyes widened slightly. "That's incredible. And dangerous."

"Everything worthwhile is dangerous." He placed the damaged implant inside the chamber, sealing it carefully. "This will take a while. You should rest—you lost blood yesterday."

"Actually," he paused, glancing at his meager supplies, "you should eat something first." He reached for one of two remaining water bottles and his last nutrition tube. "It's not much, but..."

"You sure?" Isa accepted the offerings, noting how he kept nothing for himself. "This looks like your entire emergency stash."

"I can go longer without food than you can go without recovering." He activated the nitrogen flow, creating the sterile environment his work required. "Basic resource allocation."

Isa smiled as she opened the nutrition tube. "You talk about everything like it's a technical problem."

"Isn't it?" He glanced up from his setup. "Input, processing, output. Your body needs protein and calories to repair tissue damage. Mine needs focus to repair data damage. Simple system requirements."

"Right." She took a sip of water, amusement dancing in her eyes. "And if I were a machine, what would my diagnostic readout say?"

Vyry4n paused, actually considering the question seriously. "Low-level physical trauma, elevated stress hormones, minor dehydration. Overall system stability at... maybe seventy-eight percent?"

"Seventy-eight?" Isa raised an eyebrow. "That's surprisingly specific."

"I'm good at assessments." A hint of a smile tugged at his lips. "Plus you're still sitting upright and asking technical questions, so higher cognitive functions are clearly operational."

"Clearly operational," she repeated with a laugh. "You really know how to make a girl feel special."

The comment made him pause, something flickering across his expression. "Sorry. I'm not... I don't usually have conversations."

"No, don't apologize." Isa's voice softened. "It's refreshing, actually. Most people either try to bullshit me or talk down to me. You just tell me exactly what you're thinking."

"Even when what I'm thinking is weird?"

"Especially then." She settled back against the wall, still watching him with fascination. "So what's the weirdest thing you've ever had to fix?"

Vyry4n connected the final interface cable, then looked up with something approaching enthusiasm. "Last month, someone brought me a neural implant that was supposed to enhance memory recall, but instead it made the user randomly speak in corporate marketing slogans."

"No way."

"'Nexus Industries: Your Future, Optimized' kept interrupting his conversations. Turned out the previous owner had been a marketing exec, and the implant had cached fragments of presentation data." He shook his head. "Took three hours to debug the buffer overflow."

"Poor guy. Though honestly, some marketing speak might be an improvement for most people I know."

"You'd be surprised how many 'enhanced' individuals are just walking debugging projects waiting to happen." He activated the chamber's initialization sequence. "Corporate tech looks impressive until you see the implementation details."

"Speaking from experience?"

"I fix what they break." He gestured around his cramped workshop. "Every piece of 'premium' hardware that ends up down here has the same problems—planned obsolescence, profit margins prioritized over functionality, and zero consideration for real-world use cases."

"Real-world use cases like getting shot at during riots?"

"Real-world use cases like being owned by actual people instead of corporate expense accounts." The chamber hummed to life, and Vyry4n felt his consciousness expand into the device. "Here, music player with decent headphones. Might help you sleep while I work."

Isa accepted the headphones with a small smile. "What if I want to watch the master craftsman at work?"

"It's not very exciting from the outside. I mostly just sit very still for hours while tiny robots do precise things you can't see."

"Sounds like the kind of problem I'd solve with explosives and bad language."

"Different skill sets," he agreed, settling into his work position. "Though I've seen your solution work surprisingly well."

As she put on the headphones, Isa grinned. "Stick around, and I'll teach you some truly creative profanity."

"I'll... consider that continuing education," he replied, the ghost of a smile crossing his face as he began the delicate work.

Hours passed in focused concentration, the world narrowing to the microscopic battlefield inside the memory implant. Through his neural interface, he felt each successful repair like a small victory, each recovered data fragment like finding treasure in ruins.

When he finally disconnected and stretched his cramped shoulders, he noticed Isa had fallen asleep, the headphones still on, her breathing deep and even. For a moment, he simply watched her—the way tension had left her face, the slight smile that suggested whatever she was listening to had given her pleasant dreams.

She stirred as he moved, eyes opening slowly, then widening as she focused on him.

"How long was I out?" she asked, slipping off the headphones.

"Three hours, maybe four." He carefully extracted the repaired implant from the chamber. "Ninety-two percent data recovery. Better than I expected."

"Ninety-two percent?" Isa sat up straighter. "I was told this was completely unrecoverable."

"It was, using standard methods." He held up the restored device. "Sometimes you need to think smaller."

But Isa wasn't looking at the implant. She was studying his face with an intensity that made him self-conscious.

"What?" he asked.

"Nothing, I just..." She stretched, working out the kinks from sleeping against concrete. "You've been working this whole time? Without a break?"

"Work is easier than thinking about what's happening up there." He gestured vaguely toward the chaos above.

Isa's expression softened. "You saved my life yesterday. Brought me somewhere safe. Gave me your bed, your food, worked on my job while I slept." She paused. "And you haven't asked for anything in return."

Vyry4n felt heat creep up his neck. "You're paying me for the repair work."

"That's not what I mean." She unfolded herself from the corner, moving carefully in the cramped space. "Most men... they would have made it clear what they expected. Even in a situation like this."

The observation made him uncomfortable. "I don't expect anything."

"I know." Her voice carried something like wonder. "That's what I mean."

He turned to put the repaired implant back in its protective case, needing to break the intensity of her gaze. Behind him, he heard her stand, felt the shift in the small space as they both moved in the confined area.

When he reached for something on the upper shelf, Isa stepped closer, and suddenly they were nearly touching in the narrow space between his workbench and the wall.

"Vyry4n," she said softly.

He turned, and before he could step back, her arms were around him. Not seductive or demanding—just a warm, grateful embrace that caught him completely off guard.

"Thank you," she whispered against his shoulder. "For being decent in a world that usually isn't."

The hug lasted longer than simple gratitude would require. Her body was warm against his, solid and real in a way that cut through his usual emotional barriers. He could smell her hair—still faintly chemical from the underground market, but underneath that, something uniquely her.

When she started to pull back, her hands lingered on his arms, and he realized she was looking at him with new awareness.

"I'm not asking for anything," she said quietly. "But if you wanted... I mean, if you're interested..."

"I don't want you to feel obligated," he managed.

Isa smiled—the first genuinely warm expression he'd seen from her. "I don't do anything out of obligation. But I do appreciate kindness. And competence." Her hands moved to rest on his chest. "And the way you look at broken things like they can be fixed."

"Everything can be fixed," he said automatically. "Just needs the right approach."

"Even people?"

The question hung between them in the small space. Outside, another explosion echoed, but it seemed farther away now, less important than the woman standing close enough that he could feel her breathing.

"I don't know," he admitted. "I'm not good with people."

"You're good with me," she said simply. "Though I should warn you—I'm probably more complicated than your average repair job."

"I like complicated," he replied, surprising himself. "Simple problems are boring."

"Is that a challenge?"

"Maybe."

When she kissed him, it was soft and questioning, nothing like the hurried encounters he'd had before. Her lips were warm, and she tasted faintly of the synthetic fruit flavor from emergency rations.

He found himself responding despite his wariness, his hands coming up to rest tentatively on her waist. When she pulled back to look at him, there was no demand in her expression, no impatience.

"Okay?" she asked.

He nodded, and she smiled—genuine warmth that transformed her angular features.

What followed unfolded with the same careful precision he brought to his technical work. Isa's movements were unhurried, almost ritualistic, as she helped him set aside his tools and led him to the narrow sleeping mat. When she began to undress, she guided his hands to help rather than simply enduring his touch.

"Take your time," she whispered when his fingers hesitated. "I'm not going anywhere."

Vyry4n approached her body the way he approached complex systems—methodically, curiously, learning through careful observation and experimentation. When he traced the curve of her shoulder with his fingertips, she made a soft sound that sent feedback through his nervous system like a properly calibrated sensor response.

Her skin was a map of textures and temperatures. The smooth warmth of her throat, where he could feel her pulse quickening under his lips. The slight roughness of calluses on her palms when she guided his hands to her breasts—medium-sized and perfectly proportioned to her lean frame, nipples that responded immediately to his touch. The soft hollow at the base of her ribs where she was most sensitive to gentle pressure.

Each input produced measurable outputs—the way her breathing changed when he found the spot where her neck met her shoulder, the involuntary flex of her muscles when he traced patterns along her spine, the small gasps that escaped when he learned to vary pressure and speed according to her responses.

"You're analyzing me," Isa said with amusement, her voice breathy as his hands mapped the curve of her waist.

"Is that bad?" He paused, suddenly self-conscious.

"No." Her hand covered his, pressing it flat against her ribs where he could feel the rapid beating of her heart. "It's incredible. No one's ever paid attention like this before."

Encouraged, Vyry4n continued his exploration. Her thighs were strong and smooth, muscles that spoke of years navigating slum rooftops and cramped maintenance tunnels. When his fingers traced along the sensitive skin of her inner thigh, she made a sound that was almost a purr, her legs shifting to give him better access.

She guided him then, showing him how to touch her most intimate places with the same careful attention he gave to delicate circuitry. Her responses became his feedback loop—the way her hips moved against his hand, the catch in her breathing when he found the right rhythm, the soft moans that told him when to maintain pressure and when to vary his approach.

When she reached for him, her touch was equally exploratory. Her fingers traced the lean muscles of his chest, lingering on old scars from salvage work. Unlike his previous encounters—rushed affairs where touching was minimal and connection even less—Isa seemed to genuinely enjoy the feel of his skin under her hands. When she wrapped her fingers around his length—above average and uncut—he gasped at the unexpected intensity of the contact.

"You're beautiful," she murmured against his collarbone, and the words hit him like unexpected data input, something his system wasn't programmed to process.

She showed him how to use his mouth as well as his hands, mapping the taste and texture of her skin with his lips and tongue. The salt-sweet flavor of her throat, the slight bitterness of perspiration along her hairline, the way she shivered when he traced the shell of her ear with his tongue.

When she guided him inside her, it was with careful coordination—her hands positioning him, her voice whispering adjustments until they found a rhythm that worked for both of them. The sensation was overwhelming, like every nerve ending in his body had suddenly come online at once. But instead of the frantic urgency he was used to, this was slow and deliberate, allowing him to process each new input.

Her legs wrapped around his waist, pulling him deeper, and he marveled at the perfect engineering of how their bodies fit together. The slick heat surrounding him, the way her muscles tightened and relaxed in response to his movements, the feedback loop of pleasure that built between them with each careful thrust.

"Feel me," she whispered, her hands guiding his to touch her breasts, her throat, the places where their bodies joined. "Feel us."

He did, losing himself in the sensory data stream—the way her nipples hardened under his palms, the rapid flutter of her pulse when he pressed his lips to her throat, the increasing urgency of her movements as their rhythm intensified. When she climaxed beneath him, her entire body became a symphony of response—back arching, muscles contracting, soft cries that seemed to vibrate through his bones.

The overwhelming feedback pushed him over his own edge, and for a moment his entire nervous system white-noised, every sensation merging into pure signal.

Afterward, they lay tangled together on the thin mattress, skin cooling in the recycled air. Isa's head rested on his chest, her breathing gradually slowing. One of her hands traced lazy patterns on his ribs, while his fingers found their way to her hair, surprised by how soft it was when not slicked back with industrial gel.

"Better than debugging a crashed system?" she asked with sleepy amusement.

Vyry4n considered this seriously. "Different protocols entirely. More... recursive. The feedback loops are more complex."

Isa laughed, the sound vibrating through his chest. "Only you would describe intimacy in terms of system architecture."

"It's not wrong, though." His hand stilled in her hair. "Everything responds properly if you understand the signals."

"And you're very good at reading signals." She lifted her head to look at him, something playful in her expression. "So what's my diagnostic reading now?"

He studied her face with mock seriousness. "System performance at approximately... ninety-four percent. Notable improvements in stress indicators and overall satisfaction metrics."

"Only ninety-four? I guess I'll have to work on those last few percentage points."

"Quality improvement is an iterative process," he replied solemnly. "Requires extensive testing and calibration."

"I like the sound of that." She settled back against his chest with a contented sigh. "Think you're up for some long-term research and development?"

Outside, the distant rumble of conflict continued, but somehow it seemed less important now than the simple complexity of human connection. For once, his restless mind quieted, finding peace in the careful analysis of another person's presence.

As he drifted toward sleep, it was to the sound of Isa's breathing and the satisfied hum of successfully completed work—both technical and personal.
