## The Scene

Vyr4n stood abruptly from the tactical planning table, his chair scraping against the concrete floor of the underground command center. The holographic displays showing Operation StoneBone's launch positions flickered in the sudden draft.

"I'm going to the roof," he announced, his voice carrying that particular tone that meant a decision had crystallized. "To make THE call."

Marcus looked up from the ammunition inventory. "The call?"

"One last attempt at diplomacy before we start throwing buildings at them." Vyr4n was already moving toward the vertical access shaft. "If there's even a remote chance they'll listen to reason..."

Helene rose immediately, her medical instincts recognizing the tension in his shoulders. "Mon cœur, you don't have to do this alone."

"Actually," Vyr4n paused at the ladder, "I could use witnesses. All of you—come up. They should see that the Shore has leadership, not just one crazy tech-runner with delusions of grandeur."

Marcus secured his inventory pad and followed. Zara fell in step beside him, her hand instinctively checking her sidearm. Isabella brought up the rear, already mentally composing the diplomatic angles they might need.

The climb to the surface felt longer than usual, each rung of the ladder marking another step toward war or peace. When they emerged onto the salvaged building's roof, the Citadel's lights glowed like false stars across the dark water, beautiful and untouchable.

Vyr4n set up his portable communication array with practiced efficiency, jury-rigged components interfacing seamlessly despite their disparate origins. The others arranged themselves in the shadows behind him, close enough to hear but out of the camera's range.

"Here we go," he murmured, fingers dancing across the interface. "Time to crash their party."

## Norda/\/\ Tower - Executive Floor 80

The emergency board meeting had the frantic energy of powerful people facing an unprecedented crisis. The mahogany conference table on floor 80 of Norda/\/\ Tower reflected the glow of multiple holographic displays showing South Shore Slum "disturbances"—fires, mass gatherings, what appeared to be coordinated infrastructure movements.

CEO Harrison Blackwell sat at the head of the table, his silver hair impeccable despite the late hour. Around him, the twelve board members of Norda/\/\ Corporation maintained their corporate composure, though tension leaked through in tapping fingers and nervous glances toward the windows.

"The situation is escalating beyond acceptable parameters," Blackwell stated, his voice carrying the authority of someone accustomed to being obeyed. "We have confirmed reports of organized resistance activities across multiple Shore sectors."

Board member Sarah Chen leaned forward. "Sir, our intelligence suggests this isn't random civil unrest. Someone is coordinating these movements with sophisticated planning."

The wall display showed a tactical map of the South Shore, red indicators marking areas of "suspicious activity." Each red dot represented thousands of lives hanging in the balance.

"Which brings us to the nuclear option," Blackwell continued. "A tactical strike on the primary resistance strongholds would eliminate the leadership and demonstrate the futility of organized opposition."

Several board members shifted uncomfortably. Director Williams cleared his throat. "Sir, the casualty estimates..."

"Are within acceptable parameters for maintaining operational security," Blackwell cut him off. "We're not talking about eliminating the entire workforce. Fifty to one hundred thousand casualties would preserve ninety-five percent of our labor force while ending this insurrection permanently."

The holographic conference display chimed with an incoming connection request. Director Chen glanced at her interface. "Sir, we have an unscheduled participant requesting access to the meeting."

"At this hour? Who has authorization for..."

"The identifier reads 'Vyr4n D. Deamon,'" Chen said, her voice carrying a note of alarm.

The temperature in the boardroom seemed to drop several degrees. Board members straightened in their chairs, expressions shifting from corporate fatigue to sharp attention. This was the name that had been haunting their security briefings for eighteen months.

Blackwell's jaw tightened. "That son of a bitch. He's been the architect behind every major disruption we've faced. Accept the connection. I want to see the face of our primary problem."

Williams leaned forward. "Sir, if he's managed to penetrate our security networks..."

"Then we need to know how deep the compromise goes," Blackwell finished grimly.

The display flickered, and suddenly a new participant window appeared in their secure conference interface. The image showed a young man with dark hair and intelligent eyes, sitting in what appeared to be an improvised technical setup. Behind him, shadowy figures remained just out of frame.

"Good evening, gentlemen," Vyr4n said, his voice carrying clearly through their premium audio systems. "Ladies. Thank you for accepting my call."

Director Martinez leaned forward, his face flushed with anger. "You have some nerve showing your face after eighteen months of systematic sabotage."

"Ah, my reputation precedes me," Vyr4n replied with a slight smile. "And speaking of reputations... I wanted to apologize for being such a noisy neighbor lately. I know we've been keeping the music a bit loud on our side of the water."

His expression grew more serious. "I'm hoping we can work something out so I can keep the volume down going forward. Especially since I hear you're planning some pretty big fireworks of your own to celebrate our... cultural differences."

Blackwell's eyes narrowed. "If you're referring to our response protocols, that's entirely your doing. Your organization has been the source of every major security threat we've faced."

"I prefer 'concerned neighbor,'" Vyr4n said. "And speaking of neighbors... Mr. Blackwell, I've been thinking about our relationship, and I'd like to make you an unusual proposal."

"A proposal?" Blackwell's tone dripped with disdain. "You hack into our secure meeting to make proposals?"

"I'd like you to adopt me."

The silence in the boardroom was deafening. Several board members' mouths actually dropped open. Director Chen blinked rapidly, as if trying to clear a malfunction from her visual interface.

From off-camera, faint sounds could be heard: Helene's sharp intake of breath, Marcus whispering "Jesus Christ, he's insane," and what might have been Isabella struggling to suppress laughter.

"I... what?" Blackwell managed.

"Adoption," Vyr4n continued, his tone shifting from the corporate-speak they'd expected to something unexpectedly sincere. "Look, from a strategic partnership perspective, you need succession planning. Your board lacks unified vision for post-transition leadership. I need mentorship in large-scale organizational management."

He paused, and his voice took on a more personal quality. "But honestly? Fuck the corporate synergies. You need a son to carry your legacy. I need a father to guide my purpose."

Blackwell found himself leaning forward slightly, caught off-guard by the sudden vulnerability.

"I'd love and respect you," Vyr4n continued, "not for your power or your position, but for who you are as a person. And God knows I could use some fatherly guidance right now—I feel like I'm stuck in some kind of rebellious teenage phase, you know? Making poor life choices, acting out against authority figures..."

A sound that might have been a suppressed snort came from off-camera.

Vyr4n's grin became visible. "Hell, I'd be happy if you just took me fishing sometime. We could have fun and laugh about that time we nearly blew each other up."

The absolute ridiculousness of the statement hung in the air alongside its complete sincerity. Blackwell found himself staring at this young man who had just casually referenced mutual annihilation as a potential bonding experience.

For a moment—just a moment—something flickered across the CEO's face. Curiosity, perhaps. Even a hint of... possibility? Here was someone who had systematically outmaneuvered his security forces for eighteen months, speaking about family with genuine emotion.

Board member Williams found his voice first. "This is... this is completely insane."

But Blackwell held up a hand, studying Vyr4n with an expression that had shifted from corporate hostility to something more complex. The room fell silent as the CEO processed what he'd just heard.

"You're serious," Blackwell said finally, not quite a question.

"Dead serious," Vyr4n confirmed. "About the fishing, too. I've never been fishing. Always wanted to try."

For several heartbeats, the most powerful man in the Citadel sat quietly, considering an offer that should have been ridiculous but somehow... wasn't. Not entirely. The strategic mind that had built a corporate empire was clearly turning over possibilities, even as the human part of him seemed unexpectedly moved by the genuine emotion in this young man's voice.

Then the moment passed, and the corporate mask slammed back into place.

"This is completely ludicrous," Blackwell said, but there was less conviction in his voice than before. "You think you can just... call me up and ask to be adopted? Like some kind of stray dog?"

"I think," Vyr4n said quietly, "that powerful men sometimes forget that power means nothing without someone to pass it to. And I think you're smart enough to recognize talent when you see it, regardless of where it comes from."

The background whisper that might have been Zara saying "What the fuck" was barely audible.

"Even if this ridiculous proposal weren't completely insane," Director Chen interjected, "you're forgetting that you're speaking to us from a position of weakness. The South Shore exists at our discretion."

"Which brings me to my alternative proposal," Vyr4n said, his tone remaining calm and professional. "If family isn't possible, perhaps we could discuss a more traditional partnership arrangement."

Blackwell leaned back in his chair, studying this unexpected intruder with new attention. "Partnership? You mean... negotiated terms?"

"Exactly. The Shore has capabilities you're not utilizing effectively. We could increase production efficiency by thirty percent within six months, develop new technologies you haven't even imagined, solve infrastructure problems that have been draining your resources for years."

"In exchange for?"

"Autonomy in our internal affairs. Fair compensation for our contributions. Representation in decisions that affect our communities." Vyr4n's voice carried the rhythm of someone who had thought this through carefully. "We're not asking for equality—we understand the realities of resource distribution. But we're asking for dignity."

The board members exchanged glances. Some seemed to be considering the proposal seriously. Director Williams even opened his mouth to speak.

Blackwell's hand slammed down on the table, cutting off any response. "Absolutely not. The role of the South Shore is to produce what we require while we provide leadership and direction. You seem to have a fundamental misunderstanding of your position."

"Our position?" Vyr4n asked quietly.

"You work for us," Director Chen added, her voice sharp with corporate authority. "In no circumstances can the South Shore dictate terms to the Citadel. We're already being generous keeping you employed despite the resources we provide—housing, food distribution, medical care."

"Infrastructure maintenance," Williams added. "Security services. Economic coordination."

"The entire framework that allows your communities to exist," Blackwell concluded. "And you think you can call us up and demand... what? A seat at the table? Equal partnership with your betters?"

Vyr4n was quiet for a long moment. When he spoke again, his voice carried a note of genuine disappointment. "I had hoped we could find a different path."

"The path is simple," Blackwell said coldly. "Return to your assigned roles. Cease this organized resistance nonsense. Accept that the current arrangement serves everyone's best interests."

"And if we don't?"

"Then we implement the nuclear option," Chen said matter-of-factly. "Tactical strikes on resistance strongholds. Estimated casualties in the acceptable range to preserve workforce viability while eliminating leadership elements."

"Fifty to one hundred thousand people," Vyr4n said softly.

"The mathematics of maintaining social order," Blackwell confirmed. "Sometimes harsh decisions are necessary for the greater good."

Another long silence stretched across the connection. Finally, Vyr4n nodded slowly.

"I understand," he said. "Thank you for clarifying your position. There won't be any ambiguity about what comes next."

As he spoke, several board members glanced toward the windows. Outside, across the dark water, lights were beginning to wink out across the South Shore Slum. Sector by sector, entire neighborhoods went dark in a pattern too coordinated to be accidental.

Director Martinez squinted at the display. "Are we seeing power outages over there?"

Williams chuckled. "What, did they forget to pay their electricity bill this month?"

Several board members actually smiled at that—the idea of the slum dwellers losing power over unpaid bills seemed to fit their worldview perfectly.

Vyr4n's expression didn't change, but something shifted in his eyes. "Tonight," he said quietly, "the bill is for the Citadel."

He reached toward something off-camera, and his voice carried a tone of polite finality. "Have a good evening, ladies and gentlemen."

The connection terminated.

## The Roof

Vyr4n sat back from the communication array, his expression unreadable in the dim light reflected from the Citadel across the water. Behind him, his companions remained silent, processing what they had just witnessed.

"Well," Isabella finally said. "That was... thorough."

"Adoption?" Marcus whispered, still sounding stunned. "You actually asked a corporate CEO to adopt you? And mentioned fishing?"

"Had to be sure," Vyr4n replied quietly, his hands moving slower than usual as he began shutting down the communication equipment. "Had to know if there was any possibility of finding another way."

Helene moved closer, her medical instincts recognizing something different in his posture—not tension this time, but a heaviness that hadn't been there before. "Mon cœur..."

"Fifty to one hundred thousand people," Vyr4n said, his voice carrying a weight that made the number sound personal. "Acceptable casualties to maintain social order."

He stood, folding the communication array with movements that seemed more deliberate than usual. For a moment, he just stared across the dark water toward the lights of the Citadel, and when he spoke again, his voice was quiet.

"This makes it official, you know. We're at war now. No more pretending it's just... neighborhood disputes."

Marcus already had his communicator in hand, but he paused, recognizing the moment. "Vyr4n..."

"Signal the launch crews," Vyr4n said, his voice finding its professional tone. "Operation StoneBone is authorized."

"All stations, this is Command. The word is given. Execute StoneBone."

"Execute StoneBone, confirmed," came the response through multiple encrypted channels.

The deep thrumming sounds of massive electrical systems coming online could be felt more than heard, a vibration that seemed to rise from the earth itself. In the distance, the first bright streaks appeared in the night sky as the Citadel's defense grid came fully online, responding to detected threats.

Zara moved to stand beside Vyr4n, watching the lights die across their home while new, deadlier lights began to dance in the sky above. "No regrets?"

He was quiet for a long moment, his face illuminated by the distant glow of laser emitters beginning their deadly dance across the darkness.

"No," he said finally. "It had to come to this sooner or later. Better on our terms than theirs."

"Twenty seconds until first impact," Marcus reported, monitoring his tactical display.

Vyr4n nodded, his expression calm and professional. "Let's see how their future weapons handle the Stone Age."

The first concrete projectile was already screaming through the night sky, followed by nineteen others, each one carrying a simple message wrapped in steel and stone: *You prepared for future weapons, so I attacked with the Stone Age.*

In the distance, the Crown Defense Grid's interceptor systems began their futile attempts to stop an attack their algorithms had never been designed to understand.

The war for the future had begun with weapons from the past.
