_Mood: Curious investigation leading to respectful business transaction_

### Setting

Underground tech market in abandoned subway station. Isa has been hearing stories about "The Craft" and decides to investigate this mysterious craftsman whose reputation seems too good to be true. After observing him work, she approaches with a business proposition.

### The Scene

Isa arrives at the underground market with more than her usual supply run in mind. For weeks she's been hearing whispers about someone called "The Craft"—impossible restoration jobs, military-grade work done for street prices, a ghost who works miracles with junk electronics. Professional curiosity and business instinct both demand investigation.

She finds him in a corner stall, partially hidden behind hanging cables and salvaged equipment. The setup is deliberately obscure—visible enough to conduct business, concealed enough to avoid unwanted attention. Smart.

From a distance, she watches him work. His hands move like a surgeon's, delicate and precise, finding components by touch in the dim light. There's something almost meditative about his focus as he coaxes life back into what looks like a completely destroyed neural interface.

"Most impressive performances improve with an audience," she says, stepping into his peripheral vision.

Vyry4n's hands still for just a moment—the only sign he's registered her presence. "Wasn't performing."

"No, you weren't." She moves closer, studying his workspace with professional appreciation. Everything has its place, tools arranged in patterns that speak of obsessive organization. "That's what makes it impressive."

He glances up briefly, taking in her practical clothing, the way she moves with confidence through the market's chaos, the callused hands that mark her as someone who works with technology herself. Not a casual customer.

"You've been watching for twenty minutes," he observes, returning to his work. "Most people get bored after five."

"Most people don't understand what they're seeing." She gestures toward the neural interface he's resurrecting. "That should be impossible to repair."

"Should be. Isn't." He holds up the device, diagnostic lights now showing stable green where before there had been only death. "Everything has potential. Just needs someone who understands what it's trying to do."

The statement intrigues her—not just the technical confidence, but the philosophy behind it. She places a damaged memory implant on his workbench—complex, expensive, clearly military-grade.

"They said you might be able to salvage this."

He sets down his current project and picks up her implant, fingers exploring it like reading braille. The damage is extensive—physical trauma and data corruption that would make most techs shake their heads and quote disposal fees.

"Seventy percent data recovery, maybe eighty if I'm careful," he says after several minutes of examination. "Two weeks, half payment up front. No questions about contents."

"That's better than the three other estimates I received." She counts out credits, exact amount, no negotiation needed. "I'm Isa, by the way. I deal in quality implants for clients who value discretion."

He pockets the payment with economical movements. "Vyry4n. I fix things that other people give up on."

"Including things that aren't supposed to be fixable?"

"Especially those." There's dry humor in his voice now, the first crack in his professional facade.

As she prepares to leave, she pauses. "The work I saw you doing—the technique with the micro-soldering on damaged neural pathways—where did you learn that?"

The question surprises him. Most clients want results, not understanding. "Trial and error. Lots of error, until I figured out what worked."

"Self-taught?"

"Had to be. No one else was going to teach me."

She nods thoughtfully. "If you're interested in premium components—hard to source items that could improve your already impressive work—I might be able to help. Quality recognizes quality."

He looks at her properly then, recognizing something beyond a simple business transaction. "I'll keep that in mind."

"Do that." She starts to walk away, then turns back. "And Vyry4n? Take care of that interface you were working on. Something that beautiful deserves to find the right home."

As she disappears into the market crowd, he finds himself watching her confident navigation through the chaos. Professional competence combined with genuine appreciation for craftsmanship. Unusual combination.

He returns to his work, but part of his attention remains on the possibilities her offer represents—not just better components, but maybe something like professional respect.

**Why this works:**

- Combines Isa's investigative approach with professional transaction
- Shows her research and business acumen leading to direct contact
- Demonstrates Vyry4n's awareness despite seeming focused on work
- Creates foundation for both business relationship and mutual respect
- Establishes the "fixing broken things" philosophy
- Sets up future interactions around shared professional values
- Shows both characters recognizing something special in the other

**Character Development:**

- **Isa**: Shows her strategic thinking, research skills, and ability to read people and situations
- **Vyry4n**: Reveals his awareness of surroundings despite social awkwardness, hints at teaching instincts
- **Mutual**: Establishes professional respect as foundation for deeper connection
