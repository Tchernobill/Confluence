# They First Meet - Modified Version

_Mood: Curious investigation leading to urgent business proposition_

### Setting

Underground tech market in abandoned subway station. Isa has been hearing stories about "The Artisan" and decides to investigate this mysterious craftsman whose reputation seems too good to be true. After observing him work, she approaches with an urgent data recovery job.

### The Scene

Isa arrives at the underground market with more than her usual supply run in mind. For weeks she's been hearing whispers about someone called "The Artisan"—impossible restoration jobs, military-grade work done for street prices, a ghost who works miracles with junk electronics. Professional curiosity and business instinct both demand investigation.

She finds him in a corner stall, partially hidden behind hanging cables and salvaged equipment. The setup is deliberately obscure—visible enough to conduct business, concealed enough to avoid unwanted attention. Smart.

From a distance, she watches him work. His hands move like a surgeon's, delicate and precise, finding components by touch in the dim light. There's something almost meditative about his focus as he coaxes life back into what looks like a completely destroyed neural interface.

"Most impressive performances improve with an audience," she says, stepping into his peripheral vision.

Vyry4n's hands still for just a moment—the only sign he's registered her presence. "Wasn't performing."

"No, you weren't." She moves closer, studying his workspace with professional appreciation. Everything has its place, tools arranged in patterns that speak of obsessive organization. "That's what makes it impressive."

He glances up briefly, taking in her practical clothing, the way she moves with confidence through the market's chaos, the callused hands that mark her as someone who works with technology herself. Not a casual customer.

"You've been watching for twenty minutes," he observes, returning to his work. "Most people get bored after five."

"Most people don't understand what they're seeing." She gestures toward the neural interface he's resurrecting. "That should be impossible to repair."

"Should be. Isn't." He holds up the device, diagnostic lights now showing stable green where before there had been only death. "Everything has potential. Just needs someone who understands what it's trying to do."

The statement intrigues her—not just the technical confidence, but the philosophy behind it. She reaches into her jacket and withdraws a small protective case, setting it carefully on his workbench.

"Someone told me you might be able to recover some data from this."

He sets down his current project and opens the case. Inside, nestled in shock-absorbing foam, lies a severely damaged memory implant—military-grade encryption, physical trauma that suggests violent extraction, data pathways burned by electrical overload.

"Corporate grade," he murmurs, fingers exploring the damage like reading braille. "Someone really didn't want this information getting out."

"Can you recover it?" Her tone carries professional urgency.

"Seventy percent recovery, maybe eighty-five if I'm careful," he says after examination. "Half payment up front, remainder prorated based on actual recovery percentage. No questions about contents."

"Fair terms." She counts out credits, then pauses. "This is a rush job. If you can have it done in two hours, I'll double the commission."

Vyry4n's eyebrows raise slightly—the most expression she's seen from him. The doubled payment would cover his living expenses for two months.

"Two hours for this level of damage?" He studies the implant again. "Possible, but I'll need my private workshop. Full environmental control, precision equipment."

"Whatever you need."

He pockets the up-front payment and seals the implant back in its case. "Come back in two hours. If I'm not here, wait."

She extends her hand. "I'm Isa, by the way. I deal in quality implants for clients who value discretion."

He shakes her hand briefly—callused fingers, firm grip. "Vyry4n, I fix stuff."

"Including impossible fixes?"

"Especially those." There's dry humor in his voice now, the first crack in his professional facade.

As she watches him pack his essential tools into a worn messenger bag, professional curiosity wars with business sense. When he heads toward the market's exit, she follows at a careful distance.

Vyry4n moves through the underground passages with practiced efficiency, taking routes that avoid the main thoroughfares. She keeps pace, staying far enough back to remain unnoticed. He enters a maintenance tunnel marked with faded warning signs, disappearing around a corner.

When she reaches the same corner and peers around it, the tunnel stretches empty in both directions. No side passages, no alcoves—just bare concrete walls and the distant drip of water. It's as if he simply vanished.

***

In his concrete chamber, Vyry4n activates a device that few in the slums have ever seen. The precision repair station sits in the corner of his workspace like a piece of art—a sealed chamber no larger than a toolbox, connected to monitoring equipment and gas cylinders by hair-thin lines.

He places the damaged memory implant inside the chamber and seals it, watching as nitrogen fills the space, creating an inert atmosphere free of corrosive elements. From his wrist, he extends his wrist to the side of the machine, connecting his neural interface and connects it to the machine's control system.

Suddenly, his consciousness expands into the device. Through micro-robotic arms smaller than human hairs, he can manipulate individual components within the memory implant. Every movement is precise, controlled by thought rather than muscle, operating in an environment where a single speck of dust could destroy hours of work.

The damage is bad, not just physical trauma, but sophisticated data corruption designed to trigger cascade failures. It burned specific pathways to hide specific key sectors and tracks, but not beyone his level of precision repair.

Working at near molecular level, he carefully rebuilds destroyed connections, bypasses damaged sectors, and reconstructs corrupted data patterns from fragments. It's like archaeological restoration, piecing together a destroyed manuscript one character at a time.

Two hours later, he disconnects from the machine and carefully extracts the implant. The diagnostic readout shows 95% data recovery—better than his most optimistic estimate.

***

Isa is waiting when he returns to his market stall, trying not to look as curious as she feels about his mysterious disappearance.

"Ninety-five percent recovery," he says without preamble, handing her the implant in its protective case.

"Ninety-five?" She can't hide her surprise. "You said eighty-five was optimistic."

"Seem's like I got extra-optimistic." He counts out her prorated payment based on the recovery percentage. "Data integrity verified, all accessible files catalogued."

She pockets the implant, studying his face for any hint of how he accomplished the impossible. "The three other techs I consulted said this was unrecoverable. Total loss."

"They were probably right, using standard methods." He begins organizing his tools with the same mechanical precision she observed earlier. "Sometimes you need to go beyond standard."

"I'm impressed." She pauses, making a decision. "If you're interested in premium components—hard to source items that could improve your already remarkable work—I might be able to help. Quality recognizes quality."

He looks at her properly then, recognizing something beyond a simple business transaction. "I'll keep that in mind."

"Do that." She starts to walk away, then turns back. "And Vyry4n? Whatever you did in those two hours, wherever you did it—that kind of precision deserves better clients than the ones who usually pay street rates."

As she disappears into the market crowd, he finds himself watching her confident navigation through the chaos. Professional competence combined with genuine appreciation for craftsmanship. And apparently, access to resources that could change everything.

He returns to his work, but part of his attention remains on the possibilities her offer represents—not just better components, but maybe something like a real partnership.
