Scene
Isa and Vyry4n reconnect - Mood: Rewind by Emma Hewitt
- She enter his room like a priest enter they temple, with confidence and reverence
- As she open her mouth and simply say "Hey!", time stop for Vyry4n
- He turn around, knowing already what is waiting for him, not just someone
- "Isa"
- "You've been busy"
- "..."
- "Crazy everything I hear about you all those years, it look like you became some sort of legend out there"
- Somehow, her presence somehow bring back a bit of who he was back when they met
- "I'm... I'm actually just going with the flow. How... have.. you been?"
- "I'm keeping up, some up some down, then more up"



"What happen to us Vyry4n... between you and me? I left you and I didn't wanted to, so why
  
There was a long silence.
"During the coma... The virus... it... I was trapped inside myself, with no way out. The nightmare was endless, monsters would chase me down. And then you appeared, I ran toward you and you sheltered me in your arms. Then your hands would grip my back, sinking your fingers in me and then you would rip me apart, tear me in bits. Again, and again, and always."
"Each time, I'd still run toward you, you were always my last hope"
"Sometime, it was Sev... he's lure me with hope then rip my head off and turn me into a grotesque bio-organic sculpture"
"I cannot tell how many years it lasted, time move differently in hell, but one day, Sev pulled me out, I woke up, I opened my eyes, I was back in the lab room and you were standing next to me, holding my hand"
"Then you'd plunged the other in my chest and pull out my heart and gave it to Sev how started to laugh and rejoice. It... it happened... serval times"
"And then one day, you simply didnt, you didnt do anything bad to me, nor Sev or Mira. I just kept waiting for it, for the part where one of you would kill me. Hours, days, weeks, I dont remember when I actually stopped waiting for the hurt. But when I did, you were already gone"
Quiet tears were forming at his eyes, she had a few already
