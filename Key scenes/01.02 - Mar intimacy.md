# The Riot Night
*South Shore Slum - Spring 2103 - Day 3 of riots*

The concrete walls of Vyry4n's ventilation shaft hideout trembled with each distant explosion. Through the narrow grate that served as his only window to the world above, orange light flickered against the perpetual gloom—fires that had been burning for three days now, ever since the Corpo security forces had tried to "clear" the slum's main market.

Vyry4n sat hunched over his workbench, hands moving with mechanical precision as he disassembled a damaged neural interface. The repetitive motions usually calmed him, but tonight his fingers moved restlessly, seeking distraction from the chaos above. Sparks flew as his screwdriver slipped, and he cursed under his breath.

"You're going to electrocute yourself if you keep that up," Mar said from where she lay on his narrow sleeping mat, her voice carrying forced casualness.

She'd been here for two days now, ever since he'd found her bleeding in an alley. The riot had caught everyone off guard—what should have been routine corporate intimidation had exploded into full-scale urban warfare when someone had thrown a homemade EMP grenade at a security mech.

"I'm fine," Vyry4n muttered, not looking up from his work. His shoulders carried the familiar tension of someone who'd learned early that showing weakness in the slums meant becoming prey.

Another explosion, closer this time. The single LED bulb hanging from the ceiling swayed, casting moving shadows across the cramped space. Mar had folded herself as small as possible in the corner, but even so, her presence filled the tiny room in a way that made his skin prickle with awareness.

"Hey." Mar's voice was softer now, and he heard the rustle of fabric as she sat up. "Vyry. Look at me."

He glanced over, taking in her torn leather jacket and the bandage where shrapnel had caught her shoulder. Her dark eyes watched him with an intensity that made something in his chest tighten—not fear, exactly, but recognition of something he'd been avoiding.

"You saved my life," she said simply.

Vyry4n's hands stilled on his tools. "You were bleeding. Anyone would have—"

"No." She unfolded herself from the corner and crossed the small space, kneeling beside his stool. Close enough that he could smell her skin—sweat and metal polish and something uniquely her. "Not anyone. You."

When she reached out slowly and placed her hand over his where it gripped the screwdriver, he didn't pull away. Her palm was warm, calloused from years of street deals and underground tech. The simple contact sent a jolt through his nervous system, like completing a circuit he hadn't realized was open.

"I don't know how to..." He stopped, frustrated with his own inability to articulate what he meant.

Mar's free hand came up to touch his face, fingers tracing the sharp line of his cheekbone. "You don't have to know everything. Just don't push me away. Not tonight."

When she kissed him, it was soft and questioning, nothing like the hurried, transactional encounters he'd had before—quick fumbles in dark corners that left him feeling more isolated than before. Her lips were warm, tasting faintly of synthetic fruit flavoring from emergency rations.

Vyry4n found himself responding despite his usual wariness, his hands coming up to rest on her waist. When she pulled back to look at him, there was no demand in her expression, no impatience.

"Okay?" she asked.

He nodded, and she smiled—genuine warmth that transformed her angular features.

What followed was different from anything he'd experienced. Mar helped him set aside his tools, led him to the narrow sleeping mat with patient hands. When she began to undress, her movements were unhurried, almost ritualistic, and she guided his hands to help rather than simply enduring his touch.

"Take your time," she whispered when his fingers hesitated at the hem of her shirt. "I'm not going anywhere."

Vyry4n approached her body the way he approached complex systems—methodically, curiously, learning through careful observation and experimentation. When he traced the curve of her shoulder with his fingertips, she made a soft sound that sent feedback through his nervous system like a properly calibrated sensor response.

Her skin was a map of textures and temperatures. The smooth warmth of her throat, where he could feel her pulse quickening under his lips. The slight roughness of calluses on her palms when she guided his hands to her breasts, showing him how to touch with just enough pressure to make her arch against him. The soft hollow at the base of her ribs where she was most sensitive to gentle pressure.

Each input produced measurable outputs—the way her breathing changed when he found the spot where her neck met her shoulder, the involuntary flex of her muscles when he traced patterns along her spine, the small gasps that escaped when he learned to vary pressure and speed according to her responses.

"You're analyzing me," Mar said with amusement, her voice breathy as his hands mapped the curve of her waist.

"Is that bad?" He paused, suddenly self-conscious.

"No." Her hand covered his, pressing it flat against her ribs where he could feel the rapid beating of her heart. "It's incredible. No one's ever paid attention like this before."

Encouraged, Vyry4n continued his exploration. Her thighs were strong and smooth, muscles that spoke of years navigating slum rooftops and cramped maintenance tunnels. When his fingers traced along the sensitive skin of her inner thigh, she made a sound that was almost a purr, her legs shifting to give him better access.

She guided him then, showing him how to touch her most intimate places with the same careful attention he gave to delicate circuitry. Her responses became his feedback loop—the way her hips moved against his hand, the catch in her breathing when he found the right rhythm, the soft moans that told him when to maintain pressure and when to vary his approach.

When she reached for him, her touch was equally exploratory. Her fingers traced the lean muscles of his chest, lingering on old scars from salvage work. Unlike his previous encounters—rushed affairs where touching was minimal and connection even less—Mar seemed to genuinely enjoy the feel of his skin under her hands.

"You're beautiful," she murmured against his collarbone, and the words hit him like unexpected data input, something his system wasn't programmed to process.

She showed him how to use his mouth as well as his hands, mapping the taste and texture of her skin with his lips and tongue. The salt-sweet flavor of her throat, the slight bitterness of perspiration along her hairline, the way she shivered when he traced the shell of her ear with his tongue.

When she guided him inside her, it was with careful coordination—her hands positioning him, her voice whispering adjustments until they found a rhythm that worked for both of them. The sensation was overwhelming, like every nerve ending in his body had suddenly come online at once. But instead of the frantic urgency he was used to, this was slow and deliberate, allowing him to process each new input.

Her legs wrapped around his waist, pulling him deeper, and he marveled at the perfect engineering of how their bodies fit together. The slick heat surrounding him, the way her muscles tightened and relaxed in response to his movements, the feedback loop of pleasure that built between them with each careful thrust.

"Feel me," she whispered, her hands guiding his to touch her breasts, her throat, the places where their bodies joined. "Feel us."

He did, losing himself in the sensory data stream—the way her nipples hardened under his palms, the rapid flutter of her pulse when he pressed his lips to her throat, the increasing urgency of her movements as their rhythm intensified. When she climaxed beneath him, her entire body became a symphony of response—back arching, muscles contracting, soft cries that seemed to vibrate through his bones.

The overwhelming feedback pushed him over his own edge, and for a moment his entire nervous system white-noised, every sensation merging into pure signal.

Afterward, they lay tangled together on the thin mattress, skin cooling in the recycled air. Mar's head rested on his chest, her breathing gradually slowing. One of her hands traced lazy patterns on his ribs, while his fingers found their way to her hair, surprised by how soft it was when not slicked back with industrial gel.

"Better than debugging a crashed system?" she asked with sleepy amusement.

Vyry4n considered this seriously. "Different protocols entirely," he said finally. "More... recursive. The feedback loops are more complex."

Mar laughed, a sound that vibrated through his chest. "Only you would describe sex in terms of system architecture."

"It's not wrong, though." His hand stilled in her hair. "Everything responds to touch if you know how to read the signals."

"And you're very good at reading signals." She lifted her head to look at him, something thoughtful in her expression. "You fix things because you understand how they work. How they're supposed to work."

Vyry4n stared at the concrete ceiling, feeling the weight of her body against his, the steady rhythm of her heartbeat. "Everything has a purpose. Even broken things. They just need someone to understand what they're trying to do."

"What am I trying to do?" Mar asked quietly.

He looked down at her, taking in the way the dim light caught the angles of her face, the genuine curiosity in her eyes. "Survive. Connect. Find someone who won't treat you like you're disposable."

"And what are you trying to do?"

The question hung between them. Outside, another explosion echoed from the surface, but somehow it seemed farther away now, less important than the small miracle of shared understanding in his underground sanctuary.

"I don't know yet," he admitted. "But I think... I think I'm starting to figure it out."

Mar smiled and settled back against his chest. "Good. We've got time."

They lay in comfortable silence then, two people learning that connection didn't have to be painful or fleeting. Vyry4n felt something shift in his internal architecture—not a complete system overhaul, but perhaps a crucial software update that might allow for new possibilities.

When he finally drifted toward sleep, it was to the sound of Mar's breathing and the distant rumble of a world in upheaval. For once, his restless mind quieted, finding peace in the simple complexity of another person's presence.
