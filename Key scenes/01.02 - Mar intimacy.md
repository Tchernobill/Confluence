## The Riot Night
## South Shore Slum - Spring 2103 - Day 3 of riots
The concrete walls of Vyry4n's ventilation shaft hideout trembled with each distant explosion. Through the narrow grate that served as his only window to the world above, orange light flickered against the perpetual gloom—fires that had been burning for three days now, ever since the Corpo security forces had tried to "clear" the slum's main market.
Vyry4n sat hunched over his workbench, hands moving with mechanical precision as he disassembled a damaged neural interface. The repetitive motions usually calmed him, but tonight his fingers shook slightly with each thunderous crash from the surface. Sparks flew as his screwdriver slipped, and he cursed under his breath.
"You're going to electrocute yourself if you keep that up," Mar said from where she lay on his narrow sleeping mat, her voice carrying forced casualness.
She'd been here for two days now, ever since he'd found her bleeding in an alley, her usual confidence replaced by something raw and shaken. The riot had caught everyone off guard—what should have been routine corporate intimidation had exploded into full-scale urban warfare when someone had thrown a homemade EMP grenade at a security mech.
"I'm fine," Vyry4n muttered, not looking up from his work. The lie felt hollow even to him. His shoulders were rigid with tension, and the familiar comfort of his tools felt foreign in his trembling hands.
Another explosion, closer this time. The single LED bulb hanging from the ceiling swayed, casting moving shadows across the cramped space. Mar had folded herself as small as possible in the corner, but even so, her presence filled the tiny room in a way that made Vyry4n's skin crawl with claustrophobic panic.
"Hey." Mar's voice was softer now, and he heard the rustle of fabric as she sat up. "Vyry. Look at me."
He didn't want to. Looking meant acknowledging she was here, in his space, seeing him like this. But something in her tone made him glance over despite himself.
Mar had pushed herself up against the wall, her dark hair falling across her face. Her usual leather jacket was torn at the shoulder, revealing a bandage where shrapnel had caught her. But her eyes were steady, watching him with an intensity that made him want to disappear into his workbench.
"You saved my life," she said simply.
Vyry4n's hands stilled on his tools. "You were bleeding. I fix things."
"People aren't things, Vyry."
The words hung between them, heavy with meaning he didn't want to examine. Outside, someone screamed—pain or rage, impossible to tell. Vyry4n flinched and nearly knocked over a tray of components.
Mar moved then, unfolding herself from the corner with fluid grace despite her injury. She crossed the small space in two steps and knelt beside his stool, close enough that he could smell her skin—sweat and metal polish and something uniquely her.
"You don't have to fix me," she said quietly. "I'm not broken."
"Everyone's broken." The words escaped before he could stop them, raw and honest in a way that made him want to take them back immediately.
Mar reached out slowly, telegraphing the movement, and placed her hand over his where it gripped the screwdriver. Her palm was warm, calloused from years of handling street deals and underground tech. "Maybe. But that doesn't mean we can't choose who we let close enough to see the cracks."
Another boom shook the walls. This time, Vyry4n didn't flinch—he was too focused on the point where Mar's skin touched his, the simple human contact that he'd almost forgotten could exist without pain or demand.
"I don't know how," he whispered, and wasn't sure what exactly he was admitting to.
Mar's free hand came up to touch his face, fingers tracing the sharp line of his cheekbone with surprising gentleness. "You don't have to know. Just... don't push me away. Not tonight."
When she kissed him, it was soft and questioning, nothing like the aggressive advances he'd learned to expect from the few people who'd shown interest in the past. Her lips tasted like the synthetic fruit flavoring from emergency rations and something more complex—hope, maybe, or just human warmth.
Vyry4n sat frozen for a moment, his entire nervous system shorting out like a overloaded circuit. Then Mar pulled back just enough to look at him, her hand still cupping his face.
"Okay?" she asked.
He nodded, not trusting his voice, and she smiled—the first real smile he'd seen from her since the riots began.
What followed was gentle and careful, Mar taking the lead with patient hands and whispered guidance. She helped him set aside his tools, led him to the narrow sleeping mat, her movements slow and deliberate—so different from his previous encounters, which had been hurried, transactional things in dark corners with people who wanted to be finished as quickly as possible.
When she pulled his worn shirt over his head, her fingers traced the pale scars on his shoulders—marks from crawling through too many tight spaces, cutting himself on salvaged metal. Instead of questions or pity, she simply pressed her lips to each one, as if blessing old wounds. The sensation made him shiver, nerve endings he'd forgotten existed suddenly awakening.
"You're allowed to want this," she murmured against his collarbone when he tensed, fighting the instinct to pull away from intimacy. "You're allowed to want good things."
Her own shirt came off with fluid grace, revealing skin that was pale in the LED's harsh light, marked with its own collection of scars—a thin line across her ribs, small puncture wounds on her shoulder. But what drew his attention was the way she moved, confident and unselfconscious, inviting his touch rather than enduring it.
"Take your time," she whispered when his hands hovered uncertainly over her body. "I'm not going anywhere."
Vyry4n's fingers found the curve of her waist first, mapping the soft flesh over hard muscle. His previous experiences had taught him that speed was expected, that lingering was selfish. But Mar arched into his touch, a soft sound escaping her lips that made something tight in his chest unfurl.
"Like that," she breathed, guiding his palm to the underside of her breast. Her skin was warm and impossibly soft, the weight of her filling his hand in a way that made his own breath catch. When his thumb brushed across her nipple, she gasped and pressed closer, her reaction genuine and unguarded.
The deep hunger for touch that he'd buried beneath layers of isolation and protective distance suddenly roared to life. His hands moved with growing confidence, exploring the architecture of her body—the delicate bones of her wrists, the strong line of her thighs, the sensitive hollow at the base of her throat where her pulse fluttered against his lips.
Mar's own hands weren't idle. She traced the sharp angles of his hip bones, fingers dancing across skin that had known too little kindness. When she cupped him through his worn pants, he made a sound that was half pleasure, half disbelief. Her touch was firm but patient, none of the rough efficiency he'd learned to expect.
"Let me see you," she murmured, and helped him out of the rest of his clothes with the same unhurried care. When she looked at him—really looked, her gaze traveling the length of his lean frame—he felt exposed in a way that had nothing to do with nakedness.
"Beautiful," she said simply, and meant it.
Her mouth followed the path her hands had traced, lips and tongue mapping his collarbone, the hollow of his chest, the ridge of muscle along his ribs. Each kiss was a small revelation, teaching him that his body could be a source of pleasure rather than just a tool for survival.
When she guided him to touch her in return, showed him the places that made her breath hitch and her back arch, his mind initially approached it like any other system he needed to understand. Touch here—response there. Apply pressure—monitor feedback. The same careful attention to detail that made him exceptional at electronics repair translated into learning the complex circuitry of human pleasure.
She was soft between her legs, slick with want, and when he traced gentle fingers along her most intimate places, he catalogued her reactions with technical precision. Light touch to the left—soft gasp, pulse rate increase. Circular motion—back arches, breathing deepens. Increased pressure—her grip tightens on his shoulders, output confirming successful input.
"Like that," she whispered, and he filed the data away, adjusting his technique accordingly. The nervous system was still a system, after all. Stimulus and response, cause and effect. He could read the patterns in her body language, the flush spreading across her chest like heat distribution in an overloaded circuit, the way her muscles tensed and released following predictable sequences.
But then something shifted. As he watched her face, studied the way pleasure transformed her features, the clinical analysis began to blur with something deeper. This wasn't just about correct technique or optimal output—she was trusting him with something precious, vulnerable. The realization hit him like a feedback loop he hadn't anticipated.
"Don't stop," she breathed when his ministrations grew uncertain, and he didn't. But now he wasn't just monitoring her responses—he was losing himself in them. The rhythm that made her gasp became something he craved to hear again. The pressure that made her grip his shoulders with desperate fingers wasn't just successful input/output, it was connection. When she came apart beneath his touch, her body arching and trembling, he watched her face with something approaching awe—not at his technical proficiency, but at the raw humanity of the moment.
They moved together slowly after that, carefully, her legs wrapped around his waist as he entered her with gentle precision. The sensation was overwhelming—heat and pressure and the impossible intimacy of being held, really held, by another person. Mar's hands cupped his face, keeping his gaze locked with hers as they found their rhythm together.
"Stay with me," she whispered when he started to retreat behind familiar walls of detachment. "Stay right here."
So he did, losing himself in the slide of skin against skin, the sound of their breathing in the small space, the way she felt around him and beneath him and impossibly present. When uncertainty overwhelmed him, she guided his movements with gentle hands and whispered encouragement. When the sounds of violence from above made him tense, she brought his attention back with soft kisses and the anchor of her touch.
The release, when it came, was nothing like the quick, almost shameful relief of his past encounters. Instead, it built slowly, a wave of sensation that started in his core and spread outward until he was shaking with it, her name falling from his lips like a benediction.
Afterward, they lay tangled together on the thin mattress, listening to the distant sounds of the riot. Mar's head rested on Vyry4n's chest, her breathing slow and even. One of her hands traced lazy patterns on his ribs, while his fingers found their way to her hair, marveling at its softness.
But even as his body relaxed into the unfamiliar comfort of human closeness, Vyry4n's mind remained carefully walled off. This was temporary, he told himself. A moment of connection born from crisis and fear. When the riots ended, when the world returned to its normal harsh rhythms, Mar would leave. Everyone left, eventually.
"You're thinking too loud," Mar said without lifting her head.
"Sorry."
"Don't apologize. Just... try to stay here with me. In this moment."
Vyry4n stared at the concrete ceiling, feeling the weight of her body against his, the steady rhythm of her heartbeat. Another explosion echoed from the surface, but somehow it seemed farther away now, less important than the small miracle of shared warmth in his underground sanctuary.
"Why do you do it?" Mar asked suddenly. "The repair work. The fixing."
The question caught him off guard. "It's what I'm good at."
"No." Her voice was thoughtful, analytical. "It's more than that. I've watched you work. You don't just repair things—you bring them back to life. Like they matter to you personally."
Vyry4n was quiet for so long that Mar lifted her head to look at him. His expression was distant, lost in some internal landscape she couldn't see.
"Everything deserves a second chance," he said finally, his voice barely above a whisper. "Just because something's broken doesn't mean it's worthless."
Understanding dawned in Mar's eyes. "You're not just fixing circuits and implants. You're trying to fix the world. One broken thing at a time."
"Stupid, right?"
"No." Mar settled back against his chest, her arm tightening around him. "It's the most beautiful thing I've ever heard."
They lay in comfortable silence then, two broken people finding temporary wholeness in each other's arms while the world burned above them. Vyry4n felt something shift inside him—not healing, not yet, but perhaps the first recognition that healing might be possible.
When he finally drifted toward sleep, it was to the sound of Mar's breathing and the distant rumble of a world in upheaval. But for the first time in months, the garden dream didn't come. Instead, he slept dreamlessly, held safe in the circle of another person's arms, learning that sometimes the most broken things could still provide shelter.
