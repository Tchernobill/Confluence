## Methods & Operations

### Standard Operating Procedures
- **Consultation before action:** Inner Circle debates major decisions
- **Pragmatic mercy:** Enemies who submit are integrated rather than eliminated
- **Community protection first:** Civilian safety prioritized in operations
- **Information gathering:** Extensive intelligence before engagement
- **Graduated response:** Minimal force initially, escalating only as needed
- **Long-term thinking:** Prefer sustainable solutions over quick wins

### Tactics & Strategy
- **Military Tactics:** 
  - Intelligence-driven operations (often know enemy plans in advance)
  - Combined arms squad tactics
  - Electronic warfare to control information space
  - Overwhelming force when committed (but try to avoid committing)
  - Urban warfare expertise (container stacks, civilian-dense areas)
  - Minimal collateral damage (wins civilian opinion)
  
- **Political Strategy:** 
  - Bismarckian consolidation (isolation and alliance-building)
  - Offer cooperation first, force only when refused
  - Strategic clemency for defeated enemies
  - Building legitimacy through better governance
  - Diplomatic outreach (Aurelio's negotiations)
  
- **Economic Methods:** 
  - Reduced extraction rates (25% vs 40%)
  - Legitimate business development
  - Worker protection and ethical employment
  - Long-term sustainability over short-term profits
  - Community investment to build loyalty

### Reputation & Approach
- **Public Image:** Protective, professional, vastly better than predecessor
- **Self-Presentation:** Community defenders, not exploiters; partners, not overlords
- **Reality:** Benevolent authoritarianism; still consolidating power but with genuine concern for community welfare
- **Gap:** The consultative process masks that Kyr4n ultimately controls everything; "protection" can be indistinguishable from control

## Canon Notes & Development

### Established Canon
- Founded 2114 when Kyr4n took over from Rico Vasquez
- 18-month transformation period with immediate humanitarian reforms
- Maintains Rico's revenue (~2.2M/month) while reducing extraction rate
- Territory of ~80,000 people in central Longueuil
- Inner Circle: Kyr4n, Helene, Marcus, Isa (departed/returns), Aurelio, Zara, Sedh
- Guild partnership formalized with 25% rate vs Rico's 40%
- Military professionalization under Marcus's leadership
- Eventually unifies entire South Shore under Kyr4n's leadership
- Confronts Citadel with Operation StoneBone
- Transitions to democracy after Kyr4n recognizes violence perpetuation

### Development Notes
- Need to detail specific territorial expansion sequence in Era 5
- Flesh out squad leaders (Cutter, Tank, Ghost) as recurring characters
- Develop the consultation process and how it masks authoritarianism
- Show gradual moral compromise across expansion
- Detail the economic transformation and legitimate business growth
- Explore how enhanced abilities isolate Kyr4n from normal humans
- Map the path from benevolent dictator to democratic transition

### Writer's Notes
- Inspired by: Bismarck's German unification strategy, Singapore's benevolent authoritarianism, The Wire's Hamsterdam experiment
- Central to exploring: Can good people do bad things? Can authoritarians choose democracy?
- Thematic core: Protection vs. control, cooperation vs. competition, power's corruption
- Narrative function: Vehicle for Kyr4n's 79-year character arc
- Moral complexity: Neither purely heroic nor villainous; genuinely improves lives while consolidating power
