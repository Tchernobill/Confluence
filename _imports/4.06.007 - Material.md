## Chapter 4.XX - Material

Jin's workshop occupied a converted storage bay in the compound's lower levels, a chaos of organized brilliance that only made sense to its creator. Fabrication units hummed in the corners, 3D molecular printers crafted impossibilities from raw elements, and screens displayed equations that would make most physicists weep with either joy or confusion.

"Boss! Boss, you're going to absolutely love this. I mean, you're going to want to have my babies after you see what I've accomplished here." Jin practically bounced as Kyr4n entered, his enthusiasm crackling like electricity. "Three months of development, forty-seven catastrophic failures, and one small fire that we're not talking about, but I've done it!"

Kyr4n surveyed the workshop with practiced calm, though internally he was already mapping electromagnetic fields from the various equipment. The familiar hum of technology sang against his enhanced senses—data streams he could almost taste, power fluctuations he felt like breath on his skin. "The armor?"

"Not armor. Art. Engineering pornography of the highest caliber." Jin gestured dramatically toward a sealed containment unit. "I've created something that shouldn't exist according to at least six laws of physics, but here we are, violating nature together."

Inside the unit, what looked like a simple undershirt hung on a custom form. The material seemed to shift between states—solid when still, almost liquid when it moved. Under the workshop's harsh lighting, it had an oily, prismatic quality.

"Nanotech chain mail," Jin continued, his hands dancing as he talked. "Each link is approximately 100 nanometers, woven in a recursive pattern that I may have borrowed from observing protein folding. The entire matrix is about as thick as premium silk but stronger than anything short of military-grade plating. It's like... imagine if spider silk and carbon fiber had a baby, and that baby was raised by Swiss watchmakers."

"Show me."

Jin's grin widened. "Oh, I'm going to show you things that'll make you question your relationship with conventional armor." He opened the containment unit with theatrical flair. "The beauty is in the distribution matrix. Kinetic energy hits one spot, the entire weave responds. It's like... every thread is holding hands with every other thread, and when trouble comes, they all squeeze together for support."

Kyr4n lifted the garment, surprised by its weight—heavier than expected but perfectly balanced. The material felt cool, almost alive against his fingers. "Temperature regulation?"

"Built in, though I'll be honest, the thermal exchange isn't quite where I want it. She runs a little hot when stressed, like my last three relationships." Jin pulled up a holographic display. "The electromagnetic properties are fascinating—the nano-structure creates a natural Faraday mesh that should provide excellent protection against electrical attacks. Corona discharge, targeted EMP, even those nasty little taser rounds the corps are using now."

Kyr4n began unbuttoning his shirt, and Jin made an exaggerated show of looking away. "Boss, a little warning! My innocent sensibilities!"

"Your sensibilities haven't been innocent since you were twelve."

"Fourteen, actually. Late bloomer." Jin peeked back as Kyr4n pulled on the chain mail. "How's the fit? I spent an embarrassing amount of time mapping your measurements. Purely professional, of course. Absolutely no weird folder on my personal drive labeled 'Research.'"

The moment the material settled against his skin, Kyr4n felt it. Or rather, didn't feel it. The constant background hum of electromagnetic radiation—power lines, data streams, the bioelectric fields of living beings—suddenly muffled to almost nothing. His perception sphere, usually extending several meters in all directions, collapsed to perhaps an arm's length.

He stood perfectly still, processing the sensation. It was like suddenly losing peripheral vision, or having cotton stuffed in his ears. Unsettling... but also oddly peaceful. For the first time in years, the world was quiet.

"Boss? You okay? You've got that look like when you're calculating how many ways to disable someone." Jin moved closer, tablet in hand, scanning. "Everything's reading normal. Actually, better than normal. The field dispersion is even across the entire—"

"It's perfect." Kyr4n flexed, testing the material's response. It moved like a second skin, but he could feel its presence in the electromagnetic dampening. A shield that worked both ways. "The Faraday mesh effect is more pronounced than expected."

"Is that... bad? Because if it's interfering with something, I can adjust the weave pattern. Maybe reduce the conductor density by—"

"No. It's good." Kyr4n turned, noting how he actually had to look at Jin rather than simply sensing his position. "Very good. Can you make matching gloves?"

"Gloves?" Jin's eyes lit up. "Oh, absolutely! Full articulation? Tactile preservation? Want me to integrate impact plates over the knuckles? Because I have ideas about metamaterial padding that would make brass knuckles weep with envy."

"Standard coverage. Same material properties."

"Consider it done. I can have a pair ready in four days." Jin was already making notes. "Though I should mention, the fabrication process is... intensive. Each piece needs to be custom-mapped to the wearer's exact dimensions. The molecular bonding won't work properly otherwise. It's like... imagine trying to make a fitted suit for someone, except the suit needs to know your DNA personally."

"Understood." Kyr4n paused, considering. "I need one more thing. A sheet of the material. Approximately two meters by two meters."

Jin's stylus stopped moving. His grin became positively lascivious. "A sheet. Double bed sized. Boss, are we talking about protective bedding here? Because if you're planning some kind of armored boudoir situation, I need details. For science."

"It's for testing purposes."

"Right. Testing. On a bed-sized sheet. The kind of testing that requires exactly the dimensions of—"

"Jin."

"I'm just saying, if you need protective equipment for... recreational activities, we should discuss impact ratings. Friction coefficients. How much mechanical stress we're expecting the weave to handle." His grin widened. "Will there be multiple vectors of force? Rapid compression-decompression cycles? Because the material can handle a lot of punishment, but everyone has limits."

Kyr4n's expression remained neutral, which only encouraged Jin more.

"I'll reinforce the binding matrix," Jin continued, making exaggerated notes. "Maybe add some extra flexibility in the central zones. Wouldn't want any tearing during... testing. Should I include attachment points? Reinforced edges for, say, secure fastening to a frame?"

"Standard construction will be sufficient."

"Sufficient for what, exactly? Because my engineering brain is painting pictures that my HR training says I shouldn't vocalize." Jin pulled up material specifications. "Fair warning though—the thermal regulation issue is more pronounced with larger surface areas. Might get pretty warm under there. Like, significantly warm. Sweaty, even. Just so you're prepared for your... testing."

Kyr4n pulled his shirt back on over the chain mail, the dampening field making the simple action feel oddly manual, requiring visual confirmation of buttons and holes. "How soon for the sheet?"

"Give me six days. Four for the gloves, six for the sheet. Though if you need it urgently for some pressing... experiment... I could probably rush order. Work some overtime. Really push myself to deliver what you need."

"Six days is acceptable."

"You know," Jin said, trying to sound casual, "that much material would provide excellent protection for two people. Theoretically. If they were, say, concerned about electromagnetic interference during close proximity activities."

Kyr4n headed for the door. "Send the specifications for the test protocol to my system."

"Will do, Boss. And hey—" Jin called after him, "—if your testing requires any custom modifications, maybe some strategic openings or quick-release sections, you just let me know. My discretion is legendary. Like, I still haven't told anyone about that thing with the—"

The door closed, cutting him off.

Jin stood alone in his workshop, grinning at his tablet. "He didn't deny it," he said to the fabrication unit. "That's basically confirmation."

He pulled up the design specifications, already calculating how to reinforce the weave pattern for... dynamic stress applications. The gloves would be straightforward, but the sheet—that would require some creative engineering.

"Two meters by two meters," he mused, inputting parameters. "Someone's planning something interesting."

His tablet chimed with an incoming message from Kyr4n: _Standard construction. No modifications._

"Sure, Boss," Jin said to the empty room. "Standard construction for completely normal, definitely not bedroom-related testing purposes."

He started the fabrication sequence, humming tunelessly. The gloves would take four days. The sheet, six.

And the speculation about what Kyr4n needed bed-sized armor plating for? That would keep him entertained for weeks.
