# Sparring with Zara

The training room beneath the Phoenix Recovery compound was stark—concrete walls, reinforced flooring, and minimal equipment. Just how Zara preferred it. No distractions, no cushions for the weak. She circled Kyr4n slowly, her bare feet silent on the mat, dark eyes tracking his every movement with predatory focus.

"You're thinking too much," she said, her voice flat and controlled despite the heat already building under her skin. "In a real fight, thinking gets you killed."

Kyr4n adjusted his stance, his hazel eyes calm but alert. He'd removed his usual work shirt, revealing the lean muscle beneath pale skin—and the faint scars she knew he tried to hide. "Not everyone solves problems with violence, Zara."

"Everyone dies the same way." She feinted left, testing his reaction. He didn't flinch. Good. "Ready when you are, boss."

The word 'boss' carried a slight edge of mockery. In this room, there was no hierarchy—only skill and instinct.

He moved first, faster than she'd expected. His shoulder dropped, telegraphing a right hook that never came. Instead, he swept low, aiming to knock her off balance. She leaped, twisting in the air, and brought her knee toward his temple. He blocked with his forearm, the impact solid enough to bruise.

"Better," she admitted, landing in a crouch. Her pulse quickened—not from exertion, but from something else. The way he moved was different today. More confident. More... dangerous.

They exchanged a flurry of strikes, neither holding back much. She caught his wrist, using his momentum to throw him. He rolled with it, came up behind her, and locked his arm around her throat. Not tight enough to choke—just enough to prove he could.

"Got you," he murmured against her ear.

The heat of his breath, the solid press of his chest against her back—it sent an unexpected jolt through her nervous system. She could break the hold easily, had a dozen ways to counter, but for a fraction of a second, she hesitated.

"Do you?" She drove her elbow back, catching his ribs. When he loosened his grip, she spun in his arms, hooking her leg behind his knee and taking them both to the mat.

They hit hard, her on top, hands pinning his wrists above his head. Their faces were inches apart, both breathing hard. She could feel his pulse racing under her grip, see the slight dilation of his pupils.

"Your heart rate's elevated," she observed clinically, though her own blood was pounding. "Adrenaline response is good, but—"

He arched suddenly, using core strength she hadn't known he possessed to reverse their positions. Now he was above her, his weight carefully distributed, one hand still caught in her grip while the other pressed against the mat beside her head.

"You were saying?" The corner of his mouth twitched—not quite a smile, but close.

The shift in dynamic sent heat flooding through her body. It wasn't just his unexpected skill, though that was part of it. It was the control—the careful restraint that suggested he could do more, be more, if he chose to. Her body responded viscerally to that implied power, that hidden strength.

"You're holding back," she accused, her voice rougher than intended.

"So are you."

They stared at each other, the air between them charged. She could feel the tension in his body, the careful way he kept his weight from fully pressing down. Always so controlled, so careful not to reveal too much. It made her want to push harder, to find his limits.

"Again," she demanded, shoving him off and rolling to her feet in one fluid motion.

This time when they clashed, she didn't hold back as much. Her strikes were faster, more precise, aimed at spots that would hurt but not permanently damage. He matched her, movement for movement, and she felt her body responding to the challenge, to the dance of violence between them.

When he caught her wrist and spun her against the wall, her back to his chest again, she could feel the heat radiating from his skin. His breathing was controlled but quick against her neck. One of his hands pinned both of hers above her head while the other rested lightly on her hip—a fighter's hold that shouldn't have sent electricity shooting through her nervous system.

"Yield?" he asked quietly.

She could feel the strength in his grip, the potential for more. It awakened something primal in her—the recognition of an equal, maybe even a superior, in this realm of physical dominance. The realization hit her like a physical blow, pooling heat low in her belly.

"Zara?" His voice carried a note of concern now. "Did I—"

"Shut up." She twisted in his grip, not to escape but to face him. Her eyes were dark, pupils blown wide, and she knew he could see exactly what this was doing to her. "Don't stop."

Something shifted in his expression—surprise, understanding, and beneath it, a flicker of his own heat. But then the careful mask slid back into place.

"We should take a break," he said, releasing her wrists and stepping back. Always stepping back. Always so controlled.

She wanted to grab him, to push until that control shattered, but she forced herself to remain still. Her body thrummed with unspent energy, with need that had caught her completely off guard. She'd sparred with dangerous people before, had felt the rush of combat countless times. This was different. This was...

"Tomorrow," she said finally, her tone giving nothing away despite the fire under her skin. "Same time."

He nodded, reaching for his shirt. As he pulled it on, she caught another glimpse of the scars he tried so hard to hide. Scars that suggested he understood violence more than he let on. Scars that made her wonder what other secrets he kept locked beneath that careful exterior.

After he left, she remained in the training room, working through forms until her muscles screamed and sweat soaked through her clothes. But no amount of physical exertion could extinguish the heat he'd ignited—the wanting that came from recognizing a predator hiding in plain sight.

She'd found something unexpected in Kyr4n today. Not just competence or hidden skill, but power—carefully controlled, deliberately concealed power. The kind that made her body respond in ways she hadn't anticipated.

Tomorrow couldn't come fast enough.
