# The Failsafe Protocol

## Arc 4, Chapter [X]: Containment

---

Marcus checked his chrono again, the third time in as many minutes. "You're sure about the timeline on that Nexus operation?"

Zara's eyes never left the tactical display she was updating. "Positive. I ran perimeter security for three months on their Prague facility. Standard rotation is every eight hours, shift change at 0600, 1400, and 2200. Window opens at 2230 when the night shift settles in."

"Corporate military habits die hard." Marcus allowed himself a rare smile. "Even when they're trying to adapt to criminal tactics."

"Muscle memory." Zara finally looked up from her work. "How long since you rotated out of corporate security?"

"Fifteen years. You?"

"Three." She leaned back in her chair. "Still wake up at 0500 sometimes, expecting morning formation."

Marcus nodded. Some habits carved themselves too deep to erase. The discipline that made them effective here was the same training that—

His comm unit screamed to life. Emergency frequency. Sedh's voice, clinical but strained: "Marcus. Kyr4n's workshop. Now. Bring Zara."

The transmission cut.

Marcus was already moving, muscle memory taking over. "Emergency response. Move."

Zara fell in beside him without question, both slipping into the focused efficiency that had kept them alive through corporate wars and criminal territories alike. The corridors blurred past as they navigated toward Kyr4n's private quarters.

The workshop door stood open—wrong. Kyr4n never left it open.

They stepped inside to find Kyr4n secured to a heavy chair, his wrists locked in metallic restraints that held his hands flat against a substantial metal table. Sedh's mobile unit maintained careful distance near the far wall, sensors trained on Kyr4n.

"Sir?" Marcus's hand automatically moved toward his sidearm.

"Stand down." Kyr4n's voice carried its usual controlled edge, but sweat beaded his forehead. "Minor technical difficulty."

Sedh's voice carried from the mobile unit: "The integration process is experiencing unexpected complications. Psychological stress levels are elevated beyond normal parameters."

Zara studied the setup with professional assessment. "You want to explain why you're tied to a chair?"

"Precautionary measure." Kyr4n tested the restraints without real effort to break them. "Zara, you should leave. I'd rather you not witness this particular—"

"If I shouldn't be here, then this is definitely where I want to be." Zara crossed her arms, settling into a position that suggested she wasn't moving anywhere.

A muscle in Kyr4n's jaw twitched—irritation or something else. "Stubborn."

"Practical." Her tone remained flat. "What kind of technical difficulty requires restraints?"

Kyr4n closed his eyes briefly. When he opened them, his voice carried careful precision. "I've been implementing some... upgrades. Personal enhancement protocols. The integration is proving more psychologically taxing than anticipated."

"Enhancement protocols?" Marcus stepped closer, studying Kyr4n's face for tells. "What kind of enhancements?"

"The kind that require security measures." Kyr4n's hands pressed harder against the metal table. "Sedh, what's the current estimation on stabilization?"

"Fifteen minutes should be sufficient for full integration, though the fluctuation patterns remain unpredictable," Sedh replied. "I recommend calling Dr. Vasquez for chemical sedation."

"Negative. Sedation would be useless at this stage." Kyr4n's breathing had become slightly more controlled, like someone managing pain. "Riley would be more effective at—" He cut himself off sharply.

Marcus caught the slip. "Riley? Who's Riley?"

But Kyr4n had already moved on, his attention tracking something in the empty air to his left. __"Of course you'd show up now."__

"Sir?" Marcus followed his gaze, seeing nothing.

"Nothing. Ignore that." Kyr4n straightened in the chair as much as the restraints allowed. "Marcus, there's a package on the shelf behind you. Please retrieve it."

Marcus turned to locate a small metal case among the technical equipment. As he reached for it, Kyr4n suddenly inhaled sharply, a sound of genuine pain.

"Integration spike," Sedh reported. "Psychological stress climbing rapidly."

Kyr4n's eyes tracked across empty air again, following something none of them could see. __"I know what you're going to say. Don't."__

"Boss?" Zara had moved closer, her professional concern showing through the usual stoicism.

"The package, Marcus." Kyr4n's voice carried new urgency. "Open it."

Marcus unsealed the case to reveal what looked like a tactical vest, but wrong—too many wires, too many small, carefully placed charges. "What the hell is this?"

"Failsafe vest." Kyr4n's explanation came in clipped sentences. "Shape charges oriented along the spine and neck. Install it on me."

__"Are you insane? You're going to let them put that thing on you?"__

Marcus stared at the device. "Sir, I can't—"

"We made a DEAL, Marcus!" The shout carried an edge that made both Marcus and Zara step back instinctively.

"A deal?" Zara's voice cut through the tension. "What deal? What is he talking about?"

But Kyr4n was already continuing, speaking to Marcus with the intensity of absolute command. "The remote in the case will trigger the charges. Complete neutralization of any threat." His eyes bored into Marcus's. "You know what I'm asking."

Marcus looked at the vest, understanding hitting him like a physical blow. His hands remained steady as he lifted it from the case, but his voice carried quiet reluctance. "Sir, there has to be another way."

"There isn't."

__"There's always another way! You don't have to—"__

"Comply with the order, Marcus."

The temperature in the room had begun to rise, subtle but noticeable. Marcus moved with military efficiency, securing the vest around Kyr4n's torso, the charges aligning with surgical precision along the spine.

"This is fucked up," Zara muttered, but she made no move to interfere.

"Functionality confirmed," Marcus reported, stepping back with the remote in his hand. The small device felt heavier than it should.

The metal table under Kyr4n's hands had begun to emit faint heat shimmer. He was arguing with empty air again, his voice low but intense. __"I don't care what you think about this. I won't—No. Not them. Never them."__

Sedh's sensors registered the temperature change. "Electromagnetic interference increasing. Ambient temperature rising three degrees per minute."

Kyr4n's demeanor was shifting, the controlled mask slipping to reveal something darker underneath. His voice, when he spoke to them, carried new menace. "How many bodies constitute crossing the line?"

"Sir?" Marcus felt his combat instincts activating.

"Simple question." Kyr4n's smile held no warmth. "At what point do I become the threat that requires... neutralization?" His eyes fixed on Marcus with predatory intensity. "Ten deaths? A hundred? Or do you wait until I kill someone you personally care about?"

The temperature continued climbing. Zara found herself studying this new version of Kyr4n—dangerous, unpredictable, radiating controlled violence. Against all logic, she felt drawn to it.

"Frank would know," Kyr4n said conversationally. __"Frank always knew exactly where the line was."__

"Frank?" Marcus asked. "Who's Frank?"

But Kyr4n had already dismissed the question, his attention turning to the invisible presence that seemed to occupy the space near the door. __"Still disapproving? Still think you know better?"__

The air in the workshop grew thick and oppressive. Electronic devices throughout the room began displaying minor glitches—screens flickering, status lights behaving erratically.

"You should see what I could do to the people in this compound," Kyr4n told them, his voice carrying quiet menace. "Walk through the dormitories. Touch each door handle. Leave presents in their dreams."

Zara leaned forward slightly, her professional interest piqued by this display of barely contained lethality. "Show me."

Marcus shot her a sharp look, but she ignored him.

"Show you?" Kyr4n's smile turned predatory. "You want to see what monsters look like when they stop pretending to be human?"

"I want to see what you're capable of."

__"She doesn't understand what she's asking for! None of them do!"__

Kyr4n's response to the invisible voice was sharp. __"Someone left because of what I was becoming. Should have listened to her."__

"Someone left?" Zara's voice carried new curiosity. "Who left?"

But Kyr4n was past coherent conversation now, the metal table beginning to glow with conducted heat. His breathing had become deeper, more controlled, like someone managing increasing pain through force of will.

"Integration reaching critical phase," Sedh reported. "Containment protocols remain stable, but psychological manifestations are intensifying."

The workshop had become a pressure cooker of rising temperature and electromagnetic interference. Marcus gripped the remote tighter, watching Kyr4n for any sign that the line had been crossed.

__"You're scaring them. Good. They should be scared. They should know what you really are."__

"Marcus," Kyr4n said quietly, his voice carrying the terrible calm of someone who had found peace with violence. "If I ask you to activate that device... will you?"

Marcus met his eyes steadily. "Yes, sir."

"Even knowing it will kill me?"

"Especially knowing that."

The metal table was now too hot to touch, but Kyr4n's hands remained pressed against it, the restraints forcing contact. His face showed the strain of whatever was happening inside his enhanced nervous system.

Minutes stretched like hours. The temperature peaked, electronic interference reached crescendo, and then...

Slowly, gradually, the pressure began to ease. The metal table cooled. The electronic glitches faded. Kyr4n's breathing returned to normal rhythms.

"Integration complete," Sedh announced. "All systems returning to baseline parameters."

Kyr4n slumped in the chair, exhaustion replacing the dangerous energy that had filled him moments before. When he looked up, his eyes held their normal human concern.

"Restraints," he said simply.

Marcus moved to release the locks, while Zara began removing the failsafe vest. Her hands were gentle but efficient, treating it like the dangerous device it was.

"Well," Kyr4n said once he was free, rubbing feeling back into his wrists. "That was educational."

"For all of us," Marcus replied, securing the vest back in its case. "This can't happen again."

"It won't." Kyr4n stretched, working out the stiffness from being restrained. "The integration is complete. Stable. No more... episodes."

Zara studied his face for tells. "And if you're wrong?"

Kyr4n gestured toward the case in Marcus's hands. "Then we know what to do about it."

The workshop felt normal again—just another technical space filled with equipment and projects. But all three of them would remember the heat, the pressure, and the moment when they had seen exactly what kind of monster lived behind Kyr4n's controlled facade.

And despite everything, Zara found herself hoping she might see it again.
