## Chapter 4.XX - Quiet

Kyr4n's private quarters occupied the northeast corner of the compound's upper level, chosen for its multiple exit routes and comprehensive sightlines rather than its luxury. The space was spartan by choice—a bed, a desk, two chairs, and little else. No decorations, no personal effects visible, nothing that could tell an intruder who lived here beyond someone who valued function over comfort.

The package from Jin had arrived an hour ago, delivered by a nervous courier who'd clearly been filled with wild speculation by the engineer. Kyr4n had signed for it without comment, ignoring the way the young man's eyes darted between the package and his face, searching for clues about its purpose.

Now, alone with the city's distant hum beyond his windows, Kyr4n unfolded the sheet across his bed. The material settled like liquid shadow, its surface catching the dim light in ways that seemed to bend physics. Two meters by two meters, exactly as requested. Jin had included a note:

_Boss - Standard construction as ordered. No special modifications, despite my better judgment. Thermal regulation still isn't optimal for extended contact. Try not to overheat during your "testing." - J_

_P.S. - The molecular structure is particularly responsive to electromagnetic fields. Thought you should know. For science._

Kyr4n ran his hand across the surface, feeling the nano-weave respond to his touch. Even through the chain mail undershirt he still wore, he could sense the dampening field strengthening where the materials aligned. Like standing in an increasingly soundproof room, the background noise of existence fading to nothing.

He hadn't slept properly in three years. Not since the virus had fully integrated with his nervous system, turning him into a walking electromagnetic sensor. Every power line was a hum against his consciousness. Every electronic device, a whisper. Every human biofield, a presence he couldn't ignore. The compound itself was a symphony of electrical activity that never stopped, never quieted, never let him fully rest.

The bed creaked slightly as he lay down, still clothed, on top of the covers. He pulled the nanotech sheet over himself like a blanket.

The silence was immediate and absolute.

For the first time since the infection, the world went quiet. No electromagnetic chatter. No constant awareness of every powered system in a fifty-meter radius. No sensing the guards patrolling two floors down or the surveillance systems cycling through their patterns. Just... nothing.

It should have been peaceful.

Instead, Kyr4n found himself gripping the edge of the sheet, fighting the urge to throw it off. The dampening was too complete. He couldn't sense the door anymore, couldn't feel if someone was approaching in the hallway. His carefully maintained awareness of every potential threat vector had collapsed to mere human senses. Eyes. Ears. Touch.

He forced himself to breathe slowly, to adapt. This was what he'd wanted, wasn't it? A respite from the constant input. A chance to sleep without the electromagnetic equivalent of standing in Times Square.

The thermal regulation was indeed suboptimal. Within minutes, he could feel heat building under the impermeable nano-weave. Jin hadn't been joking about the ventilation issues. The material might stop a monomolecular blade, but it also trapped body heat with uncomfortable efficiency.

Kyr4n sat up, pulling the sheet down to his waist. The cooler air was a relief, but now he existed in a strange half-state—his upper body swimming in electromagnetic noise while his lower half remained wrapped in silence. It was disorienting, like being partially submerged in water.

He lay back down, adjusting. Maybe if he folded it, reduced the coverage area...

A knock at his door made him freeze. He hadn't sensed anyone approaching. No bioelectric signature, no electromagnetic disturbance from their equipment. They'd simply appeared, human-invisible, at his threshold.

"Come in," he called, not moving from the bed.

Zara entered, her expression shifting from professional to amused as she took in the scene. "Jin's special delivery?"

"Testing its properties."

"In bed. Fully clothed. Alone." She moved closer, noting how his eyes tracked her—actually tracked her, rather than that uncanny awareness that always knew where she was. "It's working, isn't it? The dampening."

"How did you know?"

"You didn't sense me coming. Also, you look deeply uncomfortable, which is not usually an expression I associate with bedtime." She sat on the edge of the bed, careful not to disturb the sheet's positioning. "Can't sleep with it, can't sleep without it?"

"Something like that."

She studied him for a moment. "You know, most people would kill for the ability to turn off their enhancements at will. Take a break from being more than human."

"Most people didn't have their enhancements forcibly integrated into their nervous system."

The words hung between them, heavier than intended. Zara's eyes sharpened, filing away the information. She knew better than to push for details he wasn't ready to give.

"Want me to stay?" The offer was matter-of-fact, professional. "Extra security while you're... dampened."

"That's not necessary."

"Necessary and advisable aren't always the same thing." She stood. "But if you're determined to suffer through your science experiment alone, try folding it double at the torso. The extra dampening where your senses are strongest might help with the adjustment."

She headed for the door, pausing at the threshold. "Jin's taking bets on what you need it for, by the way. Current leading theory involves 'electromagnetic protection during intimate activities.' His words, not mine."

"Of course it is."

"I told him it was obviously for testing whether the material could protect against targeted EMP attacks during sleep, when you're most vulnerable."

"What did he say to that?"

"That I have no imagination." She smiled. "Sleep well, Boss. Or at least try to."

The door closed behind her, and Kyr4n was alone again with his silence.

He took her advice, folding the sheet to create a double layer across his chest. The dampening intensified, pushing the electromagnetic noise even further away. It was like sinking into deep water, pressure and quiet in equal measure.

For ten minutes, he lay still, forcing himself to adapt. The heat was uncomfortable but not unbearable. The silence was unsettling but not threatening. His security systems would alert him to any real danger. He could trust his human senses for one night.

Couldn't he?

By midnight, he'd kicked the sheet off three times, pulled it back up twice, and finally compromised by keeping it folded at his feet—close enough to grab if needed, far enough that he could still sense the building's electrical heartbeat.

It wasn't perfect. But for the first time in three years, he managed four consecutive hours of something approaching real sleep.

When morning came, he found a message from Jin: _How was the testing? Need any adjustments for enhanced performance? 😏_

Kyr4n typed back: _Thermal regulation needs significant improvement._

_That's it? No other feedback about your "testing"?_

_That's it._

_You're no fun, Boss. But I'll work on the ventilation. Give me another week._

Kyr4n folded the sheet carefully, storing it in his desk drawer. Tonight, he'd try again. Maybe a smaller section. Maybe different positioning. Maybe he'd eventually find a balance between the silence and the storm.

Or maybe he'd just learn to live with the heat.
