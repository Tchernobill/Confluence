## Discussions

**Why this works:**
Introduces crucial character naturally without forcing significance. Riley's eventual importance emerges organically.

**Character Development:**
Riley established as observant, appreciative of craft, naturally diplomatic. Kyr4n responds despite usual guardedness. Both same age creates peer dynamic.

**Technical Elements Introduced:**
Courier networks in underground market, delivery systems, professional interactions.

**Foreshadowing Elements:**
CRITICAL: This first meeting plants seeds for Riley's Arc 5 death (2115). Riley choosing to see Kyr4n's humanity/craft in first meeting parallels becoming moral anchor. The connection formed here makes later loss devastating. Riley's compass tattoo symbolizes finding direction - will later guide Kyr4n through viral transformation crisis, making their death catalyst for Kyr4n's loss of humanity. Every detail here gains tragic weight in hindsight.
