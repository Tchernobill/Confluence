# Demonstration

The Phoenix Recovery compound's training room smelled of sweat and synthetic rubber, the kind of honest work-smell that reminded Marcus of better days in legitimate military facilities. He stood with his arms crossed, watching Kyr4n check the padding on the practice mats with the same methodical attention he gave to circuit boards.

Zara leaned against the doorframe, her usual position—close enough to intervene, far enough to not crowd. Alex stood beside Marcus, practically vibrating with barely contained curiosity.

"I'm just saying," Alex continued, picking up the thread of conversation from ten minutes ago, "the math doesn't work. You're what, seventy kilos soaking wet? That enforcer you dropped last week had forty kilos on you, full combat augmentation suite, and you put him down in three moves."

Kyr4n straightened, brushing his dark hair out of his eyes. "Timing and leverage. Basic martial arts principles."

"Bullshit." Zara's voice cut across the room, casual but firm. She pushed off the doorframe and stalked closer, her movements predatory-smooth. "I've fought augmented heavyweights. Timing and leverage help, but they don't explain how you short-circuited his neural implants mid-swing."

Marcus noticed Kyr4n's shoulders tense—just a fraction, the kind of tell most people would miss. But Marcus had been watching him for years now, learning to read the micro-expressions that leaked through his carefully maintained control.

"His implants were cheap street-grade mods. They glitched." Kyr4n's tone aimed for dismissive but landed somewhere closer to evasive.

"Right." Alex nodded slowly, clearly not buying it. "And the three guys before him? The ones whose weapons suddenly stopped working? Also coincidentally cheap equipment?"

The training room's fluorescent lights hummed overhead, a steady electric drone that seemed to pulse in rhythm with the tension building in the space. Kyr4n glanced toward the exit, that familiar calculation passing behind his dark eyes—the one Marcus had learned meant he was weighing how much truth to reveal against how much easier it would be to just disappear from the conversation.

"You don't have to tell us _how_ you do it," Marcus said carefully, using the tone that usually worked—the one that said _I'm not interrogating, just concerned_. "But maybe showing us would help. If we're supposed to have your back, understanding your capabilities makes us more effective."

Kyr4n's jaw worked silently. For a long moment, Marcus thought he'd shut down completely, retreat behind that wall of technical explanations and strategic deflections. Then Zara moved, circling to cut off the exit angle, and something in her posture—protective rather than aggressive—seemed to shift something in him.

"It's..." Kyr4n started, then stopped. His fingers flexed at his sides, a nervous tell. "It's not something I can easily explain. The theory behind it requires understanding of electromagnetic field manipulation and bioelectric systems that—"

"So show us instead of explaining," Zara interrupted. "Spar with me. Nothing serious. Just enough so we can see what we're working with."

"I don't think that's—"

"I'm not asking." Zara stepped onto the mat, shrugging out of her jacket. Underneath, the sleeveless shirt revealed arms corded with lean muscle and scattered scars. "You know I can take it. And they," she gestured at Marcus and Alex, "deserve to understand who they're following into bullets."

The bluntness of it hung in the air. Marcus saw Kyr4n's resistance crumble, replaced by something that looked almost like relief—like he'd been carrying the weight of secrecy so long that even this small revelation felt like setting down a burden.

"Mild demonstration," Kyr4n said finally. "Very mild. And if I tell you to back off, you back off immediately."

Zara's smile was sharp as broken glass. "Deal."

They squared up on the mat, and Marcus noted the difference in their stances. Zara moved like water, all flowing readiness and coiled potential. Kyr4n stood looser, almost casual, but there was something in the way he held himself—like he was listening to frequencies no one else could hear.

"No full contact," Kyr4n said. "I'm going to demonstrate on blocks and near-misses. Pay attention."

Alex leaned forward, fascinated. Marcus kept his expression neutral, professional, even as his gut churned with the familiar cocktail of concern and curiosity that defined watching Kyr4n do things that shouldn't be possible.

Zara opened with a testing jab, quick and controlled. Kyr4n slipped it easily, his counterstrike stopping inches from her ribs—a palm strike that looked straightforward until Marcus noticed the air around Kyr4n's hand shimmer, heat-distortion waves rippling outward.

"Feel that?" Kyr4n asked.

Zara's eyes widened. "Heat. Significant heat. How—"

"Localized microwave emission," Kyr4n said, pulling his hand back. "Concentrated electromagnetic radiation at frequencies that excite water molecules. Against an actual target, it causes immediate tissue heating. Non-lethal in brief pulses, but extremely painful. Most opponents' instinct is to pull back from the source."

"Jesus Christ," Alex breathed. "You're a walking microwave oven."

"I'm a talking microwave even!" replied Kyr4n, with a ghost of dark humor in his voice. "I can't cook a burrito from across the room, if that's what you're worried about."

Marcus caught the deflection—the joke meant to lighten the reality of what they were seeing. The reality that their leader could burn people from the inside with a touch.
"And the other thing?" Zara asked, resetting her stance. "The electric discharge you used on Rico's enforcer?"
Kyr4n's expression shuttered slightly at Rico's name—that whole mess still too fresh, too raw. But he nodded. "Different mechanism. Similar principle. Come at me again, but expect a shock. Brace for it."
This time Zara threw a more committed combination—jab, cross, hook. Kyr4n wove through the first two, then caught the hook on his forearm and countered with a straight punch that stopped a hair's breadth from her sternum.
The crack of electricity was audible—a sharp pop like static discharge magnified a hundredfold. Blue-white light arced between Kyr4n's knuckles and Zara's shirt, and even from five meters away, Marcus smelled ozone.
Zara's muscles locked for a fraction of a second, her breath catching. Then Kyr4n stepped back and the effect released. She stumbled, catching herself with the grace of long practice, but Marcus saw the tremor in her hands.
"Fuck," she said succinctly. "That's what you hit them with?"
"A much milder version," Kyr4n confirmed. He was breathing harder now, and Marcus noticed the sheen of sweat on his forehead—whatever he was doing, it cost him something. "Full discharge can override neural implants, disrupt bioelectric signals, cause involuntary muscle contractions. Against an augmented opponent, it's often enough to create an opening."
"Against a baseline human?" Marcus asked, needing to know the scope, the danger, the responsibility of what they were protecting.
Kyr4n met his eyes steadily. "Carefully controlled, it's a taser effect. Incapacitating but not lethal. Uncontrolled..." He trailed off, but the implication settled heavy in the room.
Alex was staring at Kyr4n like he'd just witnessed a magic trick, that worshipful intensity Marcus both understood and worried about. "How long have you been able to do this?"
"Years," Kyr4n said quietly. "Since the infection. It's taken a long time to learn control, to understand what I can do without..." He gestured vaguely. "Without causing permanent damage."
The confession hung between them—the admission that there had been a learning curve, that control had to be learned, that mistakes had probably been made. Marcus filed that away with all the other pieces of the puzzle that was Kyr4n, the gaps in his history that probably held answers to questions Marcus wasn't sure he wanted to ask.
"Can you teach it?" Alex asked immediately, predictably.
"No." The word was flat, absolute. "It's not a technique. It's a function of how my body processes electromagnetic fields. The virus changed things at a cellular level. You can't learn this any more than you can learn to be taller."
Zara was still shaking out her hands, and Marcus watched Kyr4n track the movement with barely concealed concern. The care in that attention spoke volumes—he'd rather walk away from this conversation than risk actually hurting one of them.
"Does it hurt you?" Marcus asked. "Using it?"
Kyr4n's hesitation was answer enough. "There's... feedback. It's manageable. And it's better than the alternative."
"The alternative being losing fights to people who outweigh you by forty kilos," Zara said dryly, but there was warmth under the sarcasm. She crossed the mat and squeezed Kyr4n's shoulder—a brief touch that said thank you for trusting us without needing words.
Marcus saw Kyr4n's tension drain slightly at the contact, that perpetual isolation cracking just enough to let them in. It was progress. Slow, hard-won progress, but progress nonetheless.
"So when someone comes at you," Alex said, working through the tactical implications with the intensity he brought to everything, "you've got close-range heat and electrical capabilities, enhanced reflexes to set up the attacks, and probably half a dozen other things you're not telling us about."
"Probably," Kyr4n acknowledged, a hint of humor returning to his voice.
"And you hide all of this, make it look like you're just faster, just better trained, just luckier than you should be." Marcus shook his head, somewhere between impressed and exasperated. "You know that makes our job harder, right? When we're trying to plan security and we don't know what you're actually capable of?"
"I know." Kyr4n rubbed the back of his neck, that gesture of discomfort he made when confronted with the consequences of his secrecy. "It's... complicated. The fewer people who know what I can actually do, the safer everyone is. Corporate intelligence is always watching, always analyzing. If they knew the full extent—"
"They'd want to dissect you," Zara finished bluntly. "Study you. Weaponize you."
"Or eliminate me as a threat." Kyr4n's voice was matter-of-fact, but Marcus heard the years of careful survival in those words. "I'm not being paranoid. I'm being realistic."
The training room fell quiet except for the ever-present hum of electricity through the walls, the building's heartbeat of power and data flowing through conduits. Marcus thought about all the times he'd seen Kyr4n touch a control panel or interface with electronics, those moments of impossible intuition that now made terrible, beautiful sense.
"Thank you," Marcus said finally. "For showing us. For trusting us with this."
Kyr4n nodded, something easing in his posture. "You deserved to know. If we're going to keep building this, if we're going to protect people, you need to understand what you're working with."
"A walking electromagnetic warfare platform who pretends to be a simple repair tech," Alex summarized, grinning. "That's what we're working with."
"I prefer 'enhanced electronics specialist,'" Kyr4n said dryly, and just like that, the tension broke into something almost comfortable.
Zara picked up her jacket, shrugging back into it with practiced efficiency. "Same time tomorrow? You can show me what else you're hiding."
"Absolutely not," Kyr4n said, but he was almost smiling. "Once is enough."
"Actually," Alex interrupted, his tone shifting to something more serious, more calculating. He gestured toward the corner of the training room where a combat dummy stood on its charging platform—one of the newer automated models they'd acquired from a corporate surplus auction. The thing was humanoid, built from ballistic gel over a reinforced skeletal frame, equipped with basic combat programming and responsive sensors. "What about a full demonstration? Not on Zara. On the dummy."
Kyr4n's expression shuttered immediately, that careful mask sliding back into place. "That's not necessary."
"It is, though." Alex crossed his arms, mirroring Marcus's stance unconsciously. "You showed us controlled applications. Pull-your-punches versions. But when you're actually fighting, when someone's trying to kill you and we need to coordinate with you—we need to know what happens when you don't hold back."
"Alex—" Marcus started, recognizing the dangerous curiosity in the younger man's eyes.
"He's right," Zara cut in, and both Marcus and Kyr4n turned to stare at her. She shrugged, unapologetic. "Look, I felt the baby version of those abilities. They hurt, and I'm trained to handle pain. But I've also seen you fight for real, seen what you do to people who come at you hard. There's a gap between what you just showed us and what actually happens in the field. We need to see that gap."
"It's not—" Kyr4n stopped, jaw clenching. His fingers flexed again, that unconscious tell that said he was processing, weighing, calculating risks Marcus couldn't even see. "It's not pretty. And it takes a lot out of me."
"The dummy's expendable," Alex said, pragmatic as always. "And we need to understand the full scope. Not for curiosity—for tactical planning. If we're running operations with you, if we're putting people in the field alongside you, they need to know what they're supporting. What they might need to cover for."
Marcus watched Kyr4n's resistance war with the logic of Alex's argument. The kid had a point, damn him. They'd been operating in the dark, filling in the gaps with speculation and incomplete information. Every time Kyr4n returned from an encounter with impossible victories and convenient equipment failures, they'd been forced to guess at what actually happened.
"Please," Zara added, softer than usual. "We're not asking you to perform. We're asking you to trust us with the truth. All of it."
The word trust seemed to land like a physical blow. Kyr4n's shoulders sagged slightly, and for a moment Marcus saw past the careful control to the exhaustion underneath—the weight of years spent hiding, moderating, pretending to be less than he was.
"Fine," Kyr4n said quietly. "But you stay back. All of you. The dummy's shielded and reinforced, but the effects can... spread."
Alex's grin was immediate and slightly unsettling in its intensity. He jogged to the dummy's control panel, fingers flying across the interface. "Setting it to Level Five combat protocols—augmented opponent parameters, full defensive and offensive suite active."
The dummy powered up with a mechanical whir, servos engaging as it stepped off its platform. Its optical sensors glowed amber, tracking algorithms engaging. The thing moved with unnatural fluidity, ballistic gel flesh rippling over titanium bones. It was about Kyr4n's height but broader, built to simulate a heavily augmented fighter.
Kyr4n stepped onto the mat, and Marcus saw the shift—the loose, almost casual stance melting into something else entirely. Something that made the hair on the back of Marcus's neck stand up despite twenty years of military service and countless combat situations.
"Back to the wall," Kyr4n said, not looking at them. His eyes were locked on the dummy, and there was something different in his gaze now. Something predatory and eerily calm. "And whatever happens, don't interfere."
They retreated to the observation area, putting the reinforced plexiglass barrier between them and the mat. Marcus found himself holding his breath.
The dummy initiated first, combat protocols recognizing Kyr4n as a threat. It moved fast—faster than any unaugmented human could track—closing the distance with a combination strike that would have pulverized ribs.
Kyr4n wasn't there.
He'd shifted his weight, a movement so fluid it seemed to happen between heartbeats, and his palm caught the dummy's extended arm. The air around the contact point shimmered, then ignited with that same heat-distortion Marcus had seen before—but amplified, intensified, no longer carefully controlled.
The ballistic gel began to smoke.
The dummy's combat protocols adapted, trying to pull back, but Kyr4n was already moving. His other hand struck the dummy's torso—a punch that connected with a crack of electricity so loud Marcus flinched. Blue-white lightning arced across the dummy's surface, running through its frame in branching patterns that looked almost beautiful in their violence.
The dummy's servos seized. It tried to compensate, backup systems engaging, but Kyr4n gave it no time. He flowed around the frozen machine with a grace that seemed impossible, each strike precise and devastating.
Palm to the shoulder joint—heat bloom so intense the synthetic flesh began to melt, exposing the titanium frame beneath.
Elbow to the chest cavity—another electric discharge that made the dummy's optical sensors flicker and spark.
Knee to the hip actuator—and Marcus heard something fundamental break, metal screaming as it warped under forces that shouldn't be possible from a human body.
But it was the next sequence that made Marcus understand why Kyr4n had been so reluctant.
Kyr4n's hand closed around the dummy's head, and for a moment everything went still. Then the air itself seemed to vibrate, that electrical hum rising to a pitch that made Marcus's teeth ache. The dummy's sensors exploded in showers of sparks. The ballistic gel face began to bubble and run like wax near a flame.
And then Kyr4n tore the head free.
Not with brute strength—the frame was too reinforced for that. But the internal connections had melted, the neck actuators had fused and failed, and when Kyr4n pulled, the head came away trailing sparking cables and dripping synthetic flesh.
He dropped it, stepped back, and delivered a final palm strike to the dummy's chest.
The explosion of electromagnetic force was visible—a ripple in the air like a localized shockwave. The dummy's entire torso caved inward. Internal components sparked and shorted. The thing collapsed backward onto the mat, servos still twitching spasmodically, electricity dancing across its ruined frame.
The whole sequence had taken maybe fifteen seconds.
The training room fell silent except for the crackle of dying electrical systems and the ventilation struggling to clear the smoke and ozone. Marcus realized his hands were gripping the edge of the observation barrier hard enough that his knuckles had gone white.
Beside him, Alex had gone very still, that analytical intensity replaced by something closer to awe and maybe—Marcus recognized it because he felt it too—a thread of fear.
Zara breathed a single word: "Fuck."
On the mat, Kyr4n swayed.
It was subtle—barely a shift in his stance—but Marcus had been watching for it. The careful control, the predatory grace, all of it dissolved in an instant. Kyr4n's shoulders dropped, his breathing turned ragged, and when he turned toward them his face was sheet-white, sweat soaking his hair and running down his temples.
"I need—" he started, then stopped, visibly gathering himself. "I need food. A lot of it. Now."
Marcus was already moving, years of combat medic training overriding the shock of what he'd just witnessed. He hit the release on the barrier and crossed to Kyr4n in three strides, catching his arm as the younger man's knees started to buckle.
"Easy," Marcus murmured, taking most of Kyr4n's weight with practiced ease. Up close, he could feel the tremor running through Kyr4n's frame, could see the way his pupils had dilated, the shocky paleness of his skin. "Alex, protein bars from my locker. Zara, water. Move."
They moved.
Marcus guided Kyr4n to the bench, lowering him carefully. The younger man was shaking now, fine tremors that spoke of complete energy depletion. His breathing came in short, controlled bursts—someone trying very hard not to hyperventilate.
"Metabolic cost," Marcus said, understanding clicking into place. "Using those abilities burns through energy reserves."
"Calories," Kyr4n managed, the word coming out rough. "Burns through them like... like running a marathon in thirty seconds. The electromagnetic generation, the precise control, the heat production—it all requires energy. A lot of it."
Alex skidded back into the room, arms full of protein bars and energy gel packets from Marcus's emergency stash. He dumped them on the bench beside Kyr4n with the slightly frantic energy of someone who'd just watched their leader nearly collapse.
Kyr4n grabbed the first protein bar, tearing into it with none of his usual measured control. He ate mechanically, desperate, and Marcus recognized battlefield hunger when he saw it—the body demanding fuel after extreme expenditure.
Zara appeared with water bottles, her movements efficient but her eyes sharp with concern. She cracked one open and pressed it into Kyr4n's hand, her fingers lingering on his wrist for a moment—checking his pulse, Marcus realized. Smart.
"Heart rate's elevated but steady," she said quietly. "No arrhythmia I can feel."
Kyr4n nodded, swallowing. "It's just energy debt. I'll be fine in twenty minutes if I can eat enough."
Marcus watched him demolish three protein bars in rapid succession before his hands stopped shaking quite so badly. The color was starting to return to his face, that dangerous pallor fading to something closer to normal exertion.
On the mat behind them, the combat dummy sparked fitfully, its ruined torso a testament to controlled violence Marcus still couldn't quite process.
"So that's why you always eat like you're starving after a fight," Alex said, piecing it together with that analytical mind that never stopped working. "The enhanced abilities require massive caloric intake to sustain."
"During and after," Kyr4n confirmed between bites. "I can operate normally on a standard diet, but any significant use of the electromagnetic abilities—especially at full intensity—depletes reserves fast. I've learned to carry emergency rations."
"How often can you do that?" Zara gestured at the demolished dummy, her tone clinical despite the underlying concern. "Full intensity like we just saw?"
Kyr4n paused, clearly running calculations. "Once, maybe twice a day if I eat enough afterward. More than that and I risk actual physiological damage. The energy has to come from somewhere, and if I push too far, the virus starts breaking down muscle tissue for fuel."
"Jesus," Alex breathed.
Marcus handed Kyr4n another protein bar and watched him tear into it. The implications were stacking up—deadly capabilities balanced by serious limitations, incredible power that came with a metabolic cost that could kill him if he pushed too far.
"This is why you're always carrying those energy bars," Marcus said. "Why your office always has emergency rations. You're not paranoid about food security—you're managing fuel requirements."
"Both things can be true," Kyr4n said, but there was a ghost of humor in his voice now that the immediate crisis was passing. "Growing up hungry teaches you to keep supplies. But yes, the enhanced metabolism means I need more available calories than most people realize."
Zara sat down on the bench beside him, close enough that their shoulders touched—that same protective proximity she'd shown on the mat earlier. "That level of capability, those limitations—it's important tactical information. Changes how we plan operations."
"Which is why I showed you," Kyr4n said quietly. He'd finished his fourth protein bar and started on an energy gel pack, the sugar and complex carbohydrates already beginning to restore his depleted reserves. "You were right. If you're going to coordinate with me, if you're going to put people in the field where my capabilities matter, you need to understand both what I can do and what it costs."
Marcus looked at the demolished dummy again, really processing what he'd witnessed. The precision. The devastating efficiency. The way Kyr4n had dismantled a combat machine designed to simulate augmented opponents without breaking stride.
And the way he'd nearly collapsed afterward, body demanding fuel to recover from an expenditure that would have killed a normal human outright.
"You hide this every time," Alex said, and there was something like awe in his voice still. "Every fight, every encounter—you're measuring out just enough to win while making it look normal, dealing with the metabolic cost afterward where nobody sees."
"It's safer that way," Kyr4n said. "For everyone. The less attention these abilities attract, the better."
"Except now we know," Zara said. "So we can plan better. Cover better. Make sure you've got the support you need."
Marcus saw Kyr4n's throat work as he swallowed, and it wasn't just the energy gel. The vulnerability of being known, of having the truth witnessed—it sat heavy in the space between them.
"Thank you," Kyr4n said finally, so quietly Marcus almost missed it. "For not... for not looking at me differently."
"We're looking at you exactly the same," Marcus corrected firmly. "Someone who's been carrying too much alone for too long. Now you don't have to."
Zara squeezed Kyr4n's shoulder again, that wordless support that said everything words couldn't. Alex was already making notes on his tablet, that tactical mind cataloging information, building new operational frameworks around these revelations.
Marcus stood and walked to the demolished dummy, studying the melted flesh, the warped frame, the shattered components. He thought about the enforcers Kyr4n had fought, the desperate battles in dark alleys and contested territories. He thought about each encounter where Kyr4n had walked away looking barely winded while opponents with superior augmentation went down hard.
And he thought about the cost—the careful rationing of abilities, the constant threat of energy debt, the lonely burden of hiding capabilities that could save lives but also made him a target.
"We're going to need to adjust our supply logistics," Marcus said, turning back to face them. "If you're burning through calories like that, we need to make sure you've got access to high-density nutrition at all times. Especially before planned operations."

"And after," Alex added, not looking up from his notes. "Recovery protocols. We can't have you passing out post-engagement because we didn't account for metabolic requirements."
"I've been managing—" Kyr4n started.

"Alone," Zara interrupted. "You've been managing alone. Now you're not."
The training room's lights hummed overhead, steady and constant. The destroyed dummy sparked one last time before its systems finally died completely. And Marcus watched something shift in Kyr4n's expression—that perpetual guardedness cracking just a little more.
"Okay," Kyr4n said. "Okay. We'll adjust protocols."
Marcus nodded, satisfied. It was progress—real progress. Not just understanding Kyr4n's capabilities, but understanding the person beneath them. The one who'd been fighting battles on two fronts simultaneously: external enemies and the internal cost of being something other than human while desperately trying to protect humanity.
"Can you stand?" Marcus asked.

Kyr4n tested his legs, pushing himself up from the bench. He swayed slightly but held steady, that enhanced metabolism already beginning to restore his depleted reserves. "Yeah. I'm good."

"Not yet, but getting there." Marcus picked up the remaining protein bars and pressed them into Kyr4n's hands. "Keep eating. I'll arrange for proper recovery meals from the kitchen. High protein, complex carbs, good fats."

"You don't have to—"

"I know." Marcus met his eyes steadily. "That's not the point."

Behind them, Alex was already calling someone about disposing of the destroyed dummy and probably requisitioning more training equipment. Zara stayed close to Kyr4n, that protective proximity speaking volumes about loyalty and care earned through shared truth.
And Marcus thought about family—not the kind you're born into, but the kind you build from choices and trust and moments like this. Moments where secrets became shared knowledge, where vulnerability became strength, where isolation became connection.
The compound's evening shift would be starting soon. There would be people to coordinate, operations to plan, territories to protect. The work never stopped in this precarious empire they'd built from necessity and stubborn refusal to abandon their community.
But for now, in this training room that smelled of ozone and sweat and hard-won trust, they had what mattered most.
They had each other. And they had the truth.
All of it.
