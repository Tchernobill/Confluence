## Scene Information

- **Summary**: Kyr4n performs detailed examination of the android head unit discovered the previous day, discovering sophisticated neural architecture and making the decision to attempt repair rather than salvage.

- **POV Character(s)**: Kyr4n

- **Timeline**: 2108-05-02 (Thursday), Morning

- **Location(s)**: Underground utility room hideout

- **Key Events**:
  - Detailed technical examination of android head
  - Discovery of sophisticated neural architecture
  - Recognition of high-quality construction
  - Decision to attempt full repair instead of parts salvage

- **Foreshadowing Events**:
  - Hints at potential consciousness substrate
  - Kyr4n's growing curiosity about the unit's original purpose

- **Character Developments**:
  - Demonstrates Kyr4n's exceptional technical expertise
  - Shows his tendency to see potential rather than just scrap value
  - Reveals his scientific curiosity overriding pragmatic salvage instincts

- **Plot Advances**:
  - Commits to Sedh's restoration project
  - Sets foundation for consciousness emergence

- **Objects/Items Introduced**:
  - Sedh's neural architecture details
  - Specialized repair tools

- **Scene Goal**: Establish the technical sophistication of Sedh's construction and Kyr4n's decision to pursue full restoration.
