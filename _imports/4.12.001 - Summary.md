  The organisation's armoured cars burst in, Marcus's crew secure the location and Kyr4n and Riley's body are evacuated. In the middle vehicle, Kyr4n is apathic, almost unresponsive. Almost at the Compound, Kaia receive a link from trusted source, that open to footage of Kovar's immolation, it will spread on the networks. Kyr4n's condition is collapsing.
  
- **POV Character(s)**: Kyr4n (internal + external)  
- **Timeline**: immediatly following 04.06.04 - Walk Into The Crucible.md
- **Location(s)**:  
  - The Crucible
  - Inter-territorial roads
  - Organisation Compound

- **Key Events**:  
- Marcus's tactical extraction from The Crucible
- Kyr4n's severe physical condition (12% body mass loss)
- The encrypted video leak to Kaia
- Helene's horror at witnessing the footage
- Emergency medical treatment for Kyr4n's impossible physiological depletion
- Kaia's damage control operation and deepfake counter-narrative strategy
- Timeline pressure as the footage threatens to go viral



- Marcus armoured motorcade bursts through the doors of The Crucible and his crew secure the area as the last of Kovar crew disappear
- Marcus and his team find Kyr4n in severe physical distress, Riley's charred remains nearby
- Kyr4n is evacuated - he's dissociating, staring blankly
- Riley's body is recovered
- Marcus drive the vehicle while Alex monitor the surroundings from the passenger seat.
- In the back, Zara sit next to Kyr4n who is silent, head resting against the window, detached, opposite them is Helene and Kaia.
- They are all silent, the only sounds are from the electric hum of the engine and the tyres on the roads.
- Marcus radios ahead for immediate medical preparation
- Arriving at the compound, Kaia receives from trusted source a secure encrypted link to a video soon to be released
- She isolates herself, activating privacy screens and neural firewalls before accessing the feed
- She visualizes the video in her optical implant, her eyes widen, her face freezes as she watches the entire execution and immolation sequence
- Without saying a word, she picks up a tablet, nudges Helene then gives her the tablet where she casts the video
- As lights dance on her face from the tablet screen, Helene is silent at first
- Then her breathing becomes shallow as she processes Riley's execution
- Horror washes over her face as she witnesses Kovar's immolation - the inhuman screaming, the supernatural flames
- She drops the tablet, hands trembling, struggling to reconcile what she just saw with medical reality
- They arrive in the car bay of the organization
- Kyr4n is barely responsive - he's in hypoglycemic shock, pupils dilated, skin clammy and cold
- Helene shakes herself from her horror and immediately orders Kyr4n sent to the medical bay
- Upon examination, she discovers he's lost an entire 12% of body mass - severe dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, his body appears to have been drained of essential nutrients
- She begins urgent IV stabilization, wondering what kind of physiological process could cause such rapid deterioration
- Meanwhile, Kaia shows the video to the rest of the inner circle via secure tablets
- Individual reactions: Some recoil in disgust, others lean forward in fascination, one person questions if it's even real
- Marcus asks bluntly: "How the hell do we spin this?"
- Thanks to her contact, they have a head start, but timeline pressure mounts - a few hours before it go widespread
- Kaia goes full into information damage control mode, coordinating multiple teams
- Technical team begins crafting deepfake detection "evidence" to discredit the immolation footage
- Media team prepares counter-narrative materials and identifies friendly outlets for early seeding
- Security team locks down all organization communications and begins monitoring social media algorithms
- They will reframe this as Kovar's provocation and attempted assassination of Kyr4n, who defended himself
- While they will acknowledge, vaguely, the "extraordinary circumstances" of Kyr4n's survival, the immolation footage is fabricated
- The narrative: desperate attempt to turn Kovar into a martyr using "pathetic techno-voodoo-bogeyman propaganda" - complete nonsense
- One inner circle member expresses doubt: "What if someone has additional footage? What if there were other witnesses?"
- Kaia's response: "Then we double down and make them look like conspiracy theorists"
- Helene torn between treating Kyr4n and processing the impossible nature of what she witnessed
- Time pressure intensifies as preliminary social media chatter begins appearing
- The organization mobilizes all resources, knowing their credibility and Kyr4n's future depend on controlling this narrative


- **Forshadowing Events**:  
  - 

- **Character Developments**:  
  - Kyr4n:

## The Characters

- Kyr4n
- Marcus
- Evilisa
- Riley
- Kovar's crew
- Kovar
## The Events



## Details to observe

- Evilisa is a mental projection of Kyr4n's self-loathing and mental issues
- Evilisa’s shifting behaviour: toxic girlfriend playful cruelty → real grief at Riley’s death.
- The Crucible crowd’s reaction: from fear to disbelief to dispersal.  
- Kovar’s calm, deliberate presence versus Kyr4n’s controlled detachment.
- Kyr4n's attack is rooted in nano-virus creating induction field that latch of Kovar's weapon and creep up his arm and then entire body
- When Kovar began to scream, his crew try to shoot multiple time but all they weapons are locked or defectives.
- All cameras and recording devices on scene break as a result of electromagnetic interferences.

## Discutions

**Why this works:**

- [Point 01] Riley’s sudden, casual death breaks both Kyr4n and reader expectation.  
- [Point 02] Public stripping and humiliation set up a powerful reversal when Kyr4n erupts.  
- [Point 03] Kovar’s calm demeanour contrasts perfectly with Evilisa’s hysteria, heightening tension.  

**Character Development:**

- **Kyr4n**: Loses his main stabilizing bond, unleashes his power unrestrained, begins transformation into monster he feared to be.  
- **Marcus**: Reinforces loyalty, unable to stop tragedy.  
- **Mutual**: Evilisa’s and Kyr4n’s symbiosis deepens; she becomes his sole “companion” after Riley.  

**Technical Elements Introduced:**

- Kyr4n’s nanobot-based electromagnetic control at catastrophic scale.  
- Viral spread of footage as catalyst for myth-making.  
- Phoenix Recovery response tactics.  

**Foreshadowing Elements:**

- Evilisa’s obsession with Kyr4n’s weaknesses foreshadows eventual identity collapse.  
- Riley’s death sets path for Kyr4n’s descent into legend and loss of humanity.  
- The phrase “Just us” foreshadows Kyr4n’s future dependence on Evilisa.
