## The Morning After

### [Kyr4n's POV]

The communal lounge was deserted at 0630, exactly as he'd expected. Too early for most of the organization, too late for night shift personnel who'd already retreated to their quarters. Just the soft hum of recycled air and the distant clatter of someone in the kitchen several rooms away.

Kyr4n sat in the corner position—back to the wall, clear sight lines to both entrances—with a tablet he wasn't reading and coffee he wasn't drinking. He'd been here for twenty minutes, knowing she'd come eventually. Knowing they needed to talk.

He hadn't slept. Had spent the night staring at his ceiling, replaying the moment the tiles cracked, feeling phantom sensations of her body against his and the horror of realizing how close—

The door opened. Zara paused in the threshold, scanning the room with professional efficiency before her eyes found him. For a moment neither moved, and he could see her weighing whether to approach or retreat.

He set down the tablet. An invitation.

She crossed the room with her usual confident stride, but he noticed the slight tension in her shoulders, the way her hands stayed loose at her sides—ready for anything. When she reached the couch across from him, she didn't sit immediately.

"Morning," she said, voice carefully neutral.

"Morning." He gestured to the couch. "Coffee?"

"Already had three cups." She sat, maintaining professional distance, posture alert but not defensive. "Couldn't sleep."

"Neither could I."

The admission hung between them—acknowledgment without elaboration. They'd both spent the night processing, questioning, trying to understand what had happened and what it meant.

Silence stretched. Not quite uncomfortable, but weighted with things unsaid.

"We should talk about—" he started.

"Yeah." She cut him off, not unkindly. "We should."

More silence. He studied her face, looking for signs of fear, anger, regret. Found only a complicated mix of emotions he couldn't quite parse. Not running, at least. That was something.

"The tiles," he said finally, because someone had to say it. "What almost happened—"

"I know." Her voice was steady. "I was there."

### [Zara's POV]

She'd rehearsed this conversation a dozen times in her sleepless night. Practiced what she'd say, how she'd frame it, whether she'd apologize or defend or simply acknowledge. None of those rehearsals had prepared her for actually sitting across from him, seeing the shadows under his eyes that matched her own, feeling the weight of what they both knew.

The cracked tiles. The horror in his eyes. Her own complicity in pushing him there.

"I pushed too hard," she said, forcing the words out before she could overthink them. "I pushed past your limits. Past safety. That's on me."

He shook his head. "You didn't know—"

"I should have." She held his gaze. "You tried to hold back. I felt it. And I pushed harder. That's... that's my responsibility."

Something flickered in his expression—relief? Surprise that she'd acknowledged it?

"We both made choices," he said carefully. "But the fact remains that I'm..." He gestured vaguely. "I'm dangerous. Permanently. And when I lose control—"

"People could die." She finished the thought flatly. "Yeah. I got that message pretty clearly."

A figure passed in the hallway outside—distant footsteps fading away. They both waited until silence returned.

"So what do we do about it?" she asked.

### [Kyr4n's POV]

The question he'd been dreading. Because the answer was obvious, necessary, and completely unsatisfying.

"We stop," he said simply. "The physical thing. It can't happen again."

He watched her face carefully, looking for disappointment, anger, hurt. She just nodded slowly, processing.

"Because you can't control it," she said. Not a question.

"Because I can't guarantee I won't hurt you." He leaned forward slightly. "You're right that you pushed. But I'm the one who gave in. Who let it go too far. Who nearly—" He stopped, the image of crushed bones too vivid. "I can't risk that again."

"So we just... stop?" Her voice carried something complicated—not quite disappointment, not quite relief. "Cold turkey?"

"Do you have a better solution?"

She was quiet for a moment, then shook her head. "No. You're right. It's too dangerous." A pause. "I just hate that it has to be."

"So do I."

The admission surprised him. He wasn't supposed to regret the loss, wasn't supposed to miss the physical connection when it could literally kill her. But he did. Missed the moments when he could let go, when someone understood what he was and didn't flinch—before they'd gone too far.

_Before she ran,_ Evilisa's voice whispered at the edge of his consciousness. He pushed it away.

### [Zara's POV]

She should feel relieved. The decision made, the danger acknowledged, boundaries established. Clean and professional and safe.

Instead she just felt... incomplete. Like they'd solved one problem while ignoring a deeper one.

"This doesn't change the professional side," she said, needing to establish that clearly. "I'm still your bodyguard. Still part of security. We still work well together."

"Agreed." He looked almost relieved. "I don't want to lose that. You're good at what you do."

"And you trust me." She said it as fact, not question.

"I do."

"Despite me pushing you past your limits?"

"Because you acknowledged it." His dark eyes held hers. "Because you're sitting here having this conversation instead of running or pretending it didn't happen."

She nodded slowly. That made sense. In his world, honesty and accountability probably mattered more than perfection.

But the bigger question still gnawed at her. The one she'd spent all night trying to answer and couldn't.

"Can I ask you something?"

"Of course."

She hesitated, trying to find the right words. "Why did I want it? Not just the sex—the danger. Pushing you to lose control. Testing those limits." She looked down at her hands. "What's wrong with me?"

### [Kyr4n's POV]

The question caught him off-guard. He'd expected her to ask about safety protocols, or boundaries, or whether they could still work together. Not... this. Not vulnerability wrapped in self-examination.

"Nothing's wrong with you," he said carefully.

"That's not an answer." Her eyes found his again. "People don't normally seek out that level of danger. Don't normally push someone with your capabilities to—" She stopped. "There's something broken in me. I know there is. I just don't know what."

He could tell her. Could analyze the psychology of someone raised in violence, trained to kill, who'd learned to survive by becoming the weapon rather than the victim. Could explain how that created specific patterns of seeking validation through danger, testing limits to feel in control.

But that would require explaining how he knew. Would require revealing abilities he kept carefully hidden.

"You're not broken," he said instead. "You're... complex. Shaped by experiences most people never face."

"That's a non-answer." There was frustration in her voice now. "You're deflecting."

"I'm not a therapist."

"But you understand people." She leaned forward slightly. "I've seen you work. Seen how you read situations, predict behavior, extract information." A pause. "Like with Wells."

### [Zara's POV]

She hadn't meant to bring up Wells. Had planned to save that curiosity for later, when the personal crisis was resolved. But the question had slipped out, carried by frustration at his evasiveness.

His expression shuttered slightly—not quite defensive, but carefully neutral. "Wells?"

"The corporate executive. Two weeks ago." She watched him carefully. "Marcus said you interrogated him using... unconventional methods. That you got information no one else could extract."

"Marcus talks too much."

"He just said it was effective. Didn't give details." She tilted her head. "What did you do? How did you get him to talk?"

"Does it matter?"

"Yes." Because if he had methods for understanding people that deeply, maybe he could help her understand herself. "How did you know what would work? How did you read him well enough to—"

"Experience." He cut her off smoothly. "Years of observation. Understanding motivations."

"That's still a non-answer." She wasn't letting this go. "You did something specific. Something that got past his defenses and extracted information he never planned to give up. I want to know what."

### [Kyr4n's POV]

He could see where this was going. Her curiosity wasn't idle—it was purposeful. She was trying to understand if he had insights that could help her understand herself.

_Dangerous,_ Evilisa whispered. _She's getting too close to the truth._

He ignored the phantom voice.

"I used psychology," he said carefully. "Found his vulnerabilities. Exploited them."

"By dancing with him."

He blinked. "Who told you that?"

"I have sources." A slight smile. "You danced with a corporate executive during an interrogation and somehow extracted classified information. I want to know how that works."

"It's complicated."

"Then uncomplicate it for me." Her voice carried intensity now. "Because if you have methods for understanding what's really going on in someone's head, for seeing past their surface motivations to deeper truths..." She stopped. "Maybe you could help me understand what's wrong with me."

There it was. The real question beneath all the others. Not idle curiosity about interrogation techniques—a plea for self-understanding.

He should deflect again. Should maintain the mystery, keep his abilities hidden, avoid revealing too much. But she was looking at him with something like desperation beneath the controlled exterior, and he found himself wanting to help.

Dangerous impulse.

"There's nothing wrong with you," he repeated. "You're asking the right questions. That alone shows self-awareness most people never develop."

"But I don't have answers." Frustration bled through her professional mask. "I don't understand my own psychology. Why I seek danger. Why I pushed you. Why some fucked up part of me was excited by those cracked tiles before I was horrified."

### [Zara's POV]

She'd said too much. Revealed too much vulnerability. But she was tired of pretending she had it figured out, tired of sitting with questions she couldn't answer alone.

Kyr4n was quiet for a long moment, studying her face with that intense focus he sometimes showed. Like he was reading something beneath the surface, parsing data only he could see.

"The fact that you're questioning yourself," he said finally, "means you're not broken. Broken people don't examine their own motivations. They just repeat patterns without awareness."

"That's philosophical, not practical."

"You want practical?" He leaned back slightly. "You're seeking answers to questions that don't have easy solutions. That takes time. Self-examination. Maybe... guidance from someone who understands complex psychology."

"Like a therapist."

"Or someone with experience reading people." He paused. "Someone who's spent years understanding what drives human behavior at deeper levels than most people access."

She caught something in his tone—an opening, maybe. An admission that he had skills beyond the obvious.

"Someone like you," she said.

"I'm not volunteering to be your therapist."

"But you could help me understand." She pressed forward, sensing opportunity. "Your interrogation methods—if they're good enough to extract corporate secrets, they're good enough to help someone understand themselves."

"That's different."

"How?"

### [Kyr4n's POV]

Because interrogation was about exploiting vulnerabilities in others. What she was asking for—helping someone understand their own psychology—would require revealing how deeply he could actually read people. Would require admission of abilities he kept carefully hidden.

Would require trust that could be dangerous for both of them.

"Self-examination requires consent," he said carefully. "And honesty. And willingness to confront uncomfortable truths about yourself."

"I'm willing." No hesitation. "I need to understand. Can't live with these questions."

He believed her. But that didn't make it safe to reveal what he could do. Didn't make it wise to cross that line between professional boundaries and intimate psychological access.

_She's asking you to violate her mind,_ Evilisa's voice whispered. _Just like she asked you to violate her body. And look how that ended._

"I'll think about it," he said finally. Not commitment, not refusal. "But for now—we agree? The physical thing stops. Professional relationship continues. Trust remains."

She studied him for a moment, then nodded. "Agreed." A pause. "But I'm not letting the other thing go. I need answers, Kyr4n. About myself. And I think you can help me find them."

"I said I'll think about it."

"That's all I'm asking." She stood, professional mask settling back into place. "For now."

### [Zara's POV]

She'd gotten what she came for—boundaries established, professional relationship maintained, immediate crisis resolved. And something more—confirmation that he had abilities or insights that went deeper than obvious, and that maybe, possibly, he could help her understand the questions eating at her.

She'd seen his hesitation. Seen him weighing risks and benefits. Seen something almost like fear flicker across his face when she'd pushed about the interrogation methods.

Which meant there was something there. Something he kept hidden. Something powerful enough that he was careful about revealing it.

That made her want to know more.

"See you at the afternoon briefing?" she asked, shifting back to professional territory.

"1400. Conference room three."

"I'll be there." She turned to leave, then paused. "And Kyr4n?"

"Yeah?"

"Thank you. For having this conversation. For being honest about the danger." She met his eyes. "Not everyone would."

"Not everyone nearly crushed someone's hips."

The dark humor surprised her into a genuine smile. "True." She headed for the door, then looked back once more. "When you think about the other thing—the helping me understand myself thing—remember that I'm not afraid of uncomfortable truths. I'm only afraid of not knowing."

Then she was gone, leaving him alone with his coffee and his tablet and his thoughts.

### [Kyr4n's POV]

_She's going to ask,_ Evilisa's voice said as soon as Zara left. _For you to read her. To show her what's inside her head. You know that's where this is going._

He did know. Had seen it coming the moment she'd asked about the Wells interrogation. She'd made the connection—that his methods for understanding people went deeper than observation—and now she wanted him to turn those methods on her.

Wanted him to violate her mind the way she'd wanted him to violate her body.

_And you'll do it,_ Evilisa continued. _Because you can't help yourself. Because you want to understand her. Because some part of you wants that intimacy more than you want safety._

"She's asking for help," he said quietly to the empty room.

_She's asking for violation. And you'll give it to her. Just like you gave in to the physical thing. Just like you always give in._

He didn't answer. Just sat in the quiet lounge with morning light starting to filter through the high windows, knowing that Evilisa was probably right.

Knowing that when Zara asked—and she would ask—he wouldn't be able to refuse.

Because she'd looked at him with desperation beneath professional control and said _I need to understand what's wrong with me._

And he knew exactly how that felt.

_Dangerous,_ Evilisa whispered. _This is so dangerous._

Yes. It was.

But he suspected he was going to do it anyway.
