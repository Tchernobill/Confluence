### Genre/Subgenre
Semi-Cyberpunk with slice-of-life moment

### Core Themes
**Character-Driven Storytelling**
The narrative centre on the struggle of the characters and interactions among them. Their conversations, emotional journeys, and everyday exploits drive the story forward, exploring themes like mental struggle, personal relationship, isolation, and personal growth beyond the typical hero's arc.
  
**Worldbuilding Through Details and Atmosphere**
Instead of detailed explanations or expositional dialogue, the world is built through environmental details (e.g., descriptions of buildings and settings), character observations, and the protagonists' everyday experiences. This organic approach immerses readers/viewers within the story's context without feeling the need to spell everything out overtly.

**Humorously Whimsical Tone**
To counterbalance it's darker tone, it balances its slice-of-life approach with dashes of dry wit, absurdity, and gentle humor. This tonal variety keeps the narrative light-hearted while still touching upon serious topics, preventing the story from feeling overly somber or preachy.

### Novel Structure
**Story Structure**
Each "arcs" or major section follows a different protagonist whose life intersects with the main protagonist during specific phases of his evolution. The main protagonist becomes a mysterious, evolving figure whose true nature is gradually revealed across multiple perspectives.

**POV Style**
3rd person view of alternating between main protagonist and arc protagonist with insights via internal dialogue/thoughts.

**Timeline**
Dual linear timeline, main protagonist as primary and arc protagonist as secondary
