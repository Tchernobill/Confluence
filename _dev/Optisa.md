## Special Compatibility Notes

Maya naturally provides what Yan's profile indicates he most needs: **genuine desire rather than obligation, intellectual appreciation combined with physical presence, and the grounding effect of sustained, intentional touch**. Her approach to intimacy would help counter his depersonalization while honoring his need for authentic connection and sensory awareness.

Her natural tendency to initiate would address his hesitation around physical contact, while her patient, exploratory approach would accommodate his ADHD processing patterns and depression-related energy fluctuations.

Most importantly, her authentic curiosity about him as a complete person—intellectual, emotional, and physical—would provide the integration he craves between his mental life and physical experience.
