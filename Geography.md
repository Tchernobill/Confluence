# Neo-Montreal Regional Map
*Cyberpunk Reimagining of Greater Montreal - 2103*

## Regional Overview

The Greater Neo-Montreal Metropolitan Zone represents one of North America's starkest examples of economic stratification made manifest in physical geography. What was once the vibrant, multicultural heart of Quebec has transformed into a tale of two worlds: the pristine fortress-island of Neo-Montreal proper, and the sprawling industrial wasteland that surrounds it.

The region's transformation began in the 2070s when climate refugees, economic collapse, and corporate consolidation created an unprecedented urban crisis. The wealthy and powerful retreated to Montreal island, transforming it into an impregnable corporate haven, while the displaced masses settled in the deteriorating suburbs and industrial zones that became known collectively as the Periphery.

## Core Regions

### Neo-Montreal Island (The Citadel)
*Population: ~800,000*  
*Status: Corporate-Criminal Consortium Territory*

The former Montreal island now exists as a gleaming corporate playground, completely enclosed by a 40-meter high adaptive barrier wall that rises directly from the St. Lawrence River. Rather than a military fortress, it resembles a luxurious prison where the ultra-wealthy and powerful have isolated themselves from the chaos they created. The wall is an engineering marvel of corporate vanity: constructed from self-repairing metamaterials embedded with surveillance networks, climate control systems, and automated security.

**Security Systems:**
- **The Barrier Wall**: Seamless 40-meter structure combining physical barriers with energy fields and holographic camouflage
- **River Monitoring**: Underwater sensor networks, automated patrol boats, and discrete defensive platforms disguised as art installations
- **Aerial Surveillance**: Quantum radar arrays, security drone patrols, and signal jammers integrated into architectural elements
- **Gateway Controls**: Five remaining bridge access points, each a customs and security complex with biometric scanners, AI interrogation systems, and corporate approval networks

**Internal Structure:**
- **Corporate Territories**: Towering arcologies where mega-corporations operate as feudal lords with their own private armies
- **Criminal Estates**: Luxurious compounds owned by syndicate leaders who've "legitimized" their operations through corporate partnerships
- **Elite Residential**: Climate-controlled districts with artificial seasons, where board members and crime bosses live as neighbors
- **Cultural Heritage Zone**: Preserved Old Montreal serving as nostalgic playground for the powerful
- **The Exchange**: Neutral ground where corporate executives and criminal leaders conduct business
- **Government Façade**: Nominal municipal offices staffed by corporate and syndicate representatives

**Bridge Gateways:**
1. **Victoria Gateway** (Former Victoria Bridge): Corporate-syndicate joint checkpoint for "business associates"
2. **Champlain Crossing** (Former Champlain Bridge): Executive and high-level criminal access
3. **Jacques-Cartier Passage** (Former Jacques Cartier Bridge): Controlled civilian transit and tourism
4. **Mercier Transit** (Former Mercier Bridge): Cargo, service workers, and "business consultations"
5. **Louis-Hippolyte Gate** (Former Tunnel access): Private access for the most powerful players

### South Shore Slum (The Periphery)
*Population: ~3.2 million*  
*Status: Unincorporated Industrial Zone*

The former South Shore suburbs have devolved into a massive shantytown stretching from the St. Lawrence to the poisoned shores of Lake Champlain. This is where the majority of Greater Montreal's population now resides, in a complex ecosystem of survival, black markets, and underground innovation.

**Districts:**
- **Riverside Industrial**: Former Longueuil area, now dominated by scrap yards, underground workshops, and makeshift factories
- **The Stacks**: Vertical slums built from shipping containers and industrial waste, housing millions in precarious conditions
- **Toxic Gardens**: Contaminated agricultural zones where desperate farmers grow food in polluted soil
- **The Underground**: Extensive tunnel networks connecting basements, sewers, and abandoned subway lines

**Key Locations:**
- **Phoenix Recovery District**: [[03.Hobbies/Writing/Confluence/Characters/Kyr4n/Kyr4n]]'s territory, known for relatively high safety and quality tech services
- **The Market Maze**: Sprawling bazaar built in abandoned shopping centers and parking structures
- **Scavenger Zones**: Dangerous areas where tech salvagers hunt for valuable components
- **Medical Black Markets**: Underground clinics offering everything from basic healthcare to illegal augmentations

**Social Structure:**
- **Tech Crews**: Skilled workers who maintain Citadel systems remotely
- **Scavenger Guilds**: Organized groups that harvest materials from industrial ruins
- **Underground Entrepreneurs**: Small business owners like [[03.Hobbies/Writing/Confluence/Characters/Isa/Isa]] who provide essential services
- **Survival Communities**: Informal networks of mutual aid and protection

### The Champlain Wastes
*Status: Environmental Dead Zone*

Lake Champlain and its surrounding basin have become an apocalyptic landscape of industrial devastation. Decades of unregulated mining, chemical dumping, and corporate negligence have transformed this once-pristine region into a toxic wasteland that serves as both resource extraction zone and dumping ground.

**Environmental Conditions:**
- **Acid Lakes**: Lake Champlain's pH levels make it uninhabitable for most life forms
- **Toxic Storms**: Weather patterns carry contaminated particles across the region
- **Radioactive Deposits**: Illegal nuclear waste dumping has created permanent hazard zones
- **Chemical Geysers**: Industrial runoff creates unpredictable toxic eruptions

**Industrial Operations:**
- **Strip Mining Complexes**: Massive automated operations extracting rare earth minerals
- **Waste Processing**: Corporate disposal facilities handling Citadel's refuse
- **Chem Labs**: Illegal research facilities developing everything from bioweapons to recreational drugs
- **Salvage Operations**: High-risk, high-reward scavenging from abandoned industrial sites

**Inhabitants:**
- **Waste Runners**: Heavily augmented workers who can survive toxic environments
- **Chem Cults**: Religious groups believing contamination brings transcendence
- **Corporate Prisoners**: Workers trapped in debt bondage to industrial complexes
- **Mutant Communities**: Populations adapted to toxic conditions through illegal biomodification

## Peripheral Regions

### The Ottawa Valley Communes
*Population: ~400,000*  
*Status: Independent Agricultural Collective*

The former Ottawa-Gatineau region has transformed into a network of self-sufficient agricultural communes, representing one of the few stable alternatives to both corporate dominance and slum desperation. These communities practice sustainable technology and maintain careful neutrality in regional conflicts.

**Characteristics:**
- **Eco-Tech Integration**: Advanced permaculture combined with selective high technology
- **Defensive Isolation**: Natural barriers reinforced with subtle but effective security systems
- **Resource Independence**: Closed-loop systems for energy, food, and manufacturing
- **Cultural Preservation**: Maintenance of pre-collapse Quebec and Canadian cultural traditions

**Trade Relations:**
- Selective food exports to both Citadel and Slums
- Advanced agricultural technology development
- Neutral ground for inter-regional negotiations
- Refugee processing for those seeking alternatives

### The Thousand Islands Sanctuaries
*Population: ~50,000*  
*Status: Autonomous Research Enclaves*

The St. Lawrence River's thousand islands have become home to small, independent research communities and artist collectives. Each island maintains its own character and governance, from scientific research stations to neo-monasteries dedicated to preserving human knowledge.

**Notable Islands:**
- **AI Research Station Alpha**: Neutral ground for consciousness studies
- **The Monastery of Digital Texts**: Preserving pre-collapse literature and culture
- **Biotechnology Cooperatives**: Ethical augmentation research
- **Artists' Collectives**: Cultural centers producing art that bridges old and new worlds

### The Northern Reaches (Corporate Playground)
*Population: ~150,000*  
*Status: Luxury Resort and Research Complex*

The former Laurentian Mountains region has been transformed into an exclusive retreat zone for Citadel elites, featuring luxury resorts, private research facilities, and "hunting preserves" where corporate executives and crime bosses conduct their most sensitive business away from surveillance.

**Key Facilities:**
- **Executive Retreats**: Luxury compounds where deals are made in complete privacy
- **Research Campuses**: Corporate and criminal R&D facilities developing profitable technologies
- **The Preserve**: Artificial wilderness where powerful figures "hunt" (both animals and occasionally people who've crossed them)
- **Rehabilitation Centers**: High-end addiction treatment facilities doubling as neutral meeting grounds

**Strategic Importance:**
- Private meeting grounds for power brokers who distrust each other
- Development of exclusive technologies (luxury goods, enhancement procedures, surveillance tools)
- Isolated facilities for "disappearing" problems or people
- Source of clean water and organic food for Citadel consumption

### The Eastern Townships Borderlands
*Population: ~300,000*  
*Status: Corporate-Criminal Frontier*

The former Eastern Townships have become a testing ground where ambitious corporate executives and up-and-coming criminal leaders compete for resources, territory, and influence. This lawless region serves as both proving ground for future Citadel membership and dumping ground for those who've fallen from grace.

**Power Centers:**
- **Corporate Pilot Projects**: Experimental business ventures testing new exploitation models
- **Syndicate Territories**: Criminal organizations building their credentials for Citadel recognition
- **Exile Communities**: Former Citadel residents who lost power struggles but were too valuable to simply eliminate
- **Free Trade Zones**: Neutral territories where all factions conduct business under agreed-upon rules

**Notable Features:**
- **The Trial Grounds**: Region where potential Citadel members prove their worth through successful ventures
- **Resource Wars**: Ongoing competition for mining rights, water sources, and agricultural land
- **Underground Railroads**: Hidden networks moving people, information, and contraband between regions
- **The Bazaars**: Massive temporary markets where all factions trade goods, services, and information

## Power Structure and Governance
