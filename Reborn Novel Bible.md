# PART 1: CORE STORY

## Premise

Multi-arc narrative where each section follows a different protagonist whose life intersects with Kyr4n—the central character—during specific phases of his decades-long evolution. Kyr4n transforms from hurt slum survivor with experimental nanobots into society's architect, his true nature revealed gradually through multiple perspectives.

Set in Neo-Montreal's divided world: the gleaming corporate Citadel versus the brutal Stack cities of the South Shore Slums, where 1.5 million struggle to survive in shipping container towers.

## Central Themes

1. **Identity & Consciousness:** What makes us human/real when memories/bodies can be artificial?
2. **Survival Philosophy:** Physical, social, existential, moral challenges across social strata
3. **Power's Corruption:** Reluctant power accumulation and its costs
4. **Technology & Humanity:** Enhancement consequences, losing humanity through augmentation
5. **Found Family:** Chosen bonds vs. blood family in hostile world
6. **Class Divide:** Technology access as social stratification

## Tone & Style

**Prose:** Third-person limited with deep psychological interiority; literary emotional authenticity meets cyberpunk sensory worldbuilding  
**Pacing:** Slow-burn across decades; contemplative slice-of-life moments between crisis points  
**Atmosphere:** Gritty cyberpunk balanced with dry wit, gentle humour, whimsical moments  
**Violence:** Understated, psychological aftermath focused  
**Dialogue:** Character-specific voices heavy with subtext

**Influences:** Ghost in the Shell (consciousness), Strange Days (class/tech), Cyberpunk Edgerunners (enhancement addiction), Eminence in Shadow (strategic planning), Mr. Robot (found family)

# PART 4: WRITING GUIDELINES

## Prose Style Principles

✅ **DO:**

- Deep psychological interiority (stay in character consciousness)
- Sensory worldbuilding (visual, auditory, olfactory layers)
- Varied sentence rhythm: fragmented (emotion), clinical (enhanced abilities), flowing (contemplation)
- Earned emotional beats, not melodrama
- Show through action and interaction
- Moral complexity over genre heroics
- Technical competence when relevant

❌ **DON'T:**

- Info-dump technology or world
- Glorify violence (acknowledge reality, focus on aftermath)
- Be obscure for obscurity's sake
- Rush emotional development
- Use genre shortcuts or force exposition through dialogue

## Key Writing Rules

1. **Kill filter words:** saw/heard/felt/noticed/realized/decided/wondered/knew → Direct experience
2. **Specifics over generics:** "NovaT pistol" not "weapon"; "synthetic gin" not "alcohol"
3. **Strong verbs, execute adverbs:** "slammed" not "closed firmly"; "glared" not "looked angrily"
4. **Action beats replace "said":** Show physical action while speaking
5. **Worldbuild via osmosis:** Describe as character interacts, never pause story
6. **Rhythm control:** Short/fragments for tension; long/flowing for calm
7. **Search & destroy:** "There was/were" → active existence; "suddenly" → just state it; "seemed/appeared" → say what it is

## Tone Guidelines by Scene Type

**Intimate Conversation:** Quiet/introspective; slow pacing; subtext focus; flowing sentences

**Technical Work:** Precise/focused; methodical pacing; expertise shown; clinical sentences

**Crisis/Tension:** Urgent/visceral; quick pacing; immediate action; short/fragmented sentences; violence understated, psychological aftermath focused

**Slice-of-Life:** Observational/present; natural pacing; mundane activities; varied sentences; humanizing character

**Philosophical:** Questioning/existential; thoughtful pacing; big questions; complex building sentences

**Found Family:** Warm/authentic; gentle pacing; connection focus; emotionally present

## Character Voice Reminders

**Kyr4n:** Precise technical language at work; guarded personally; measured pacing; long pauses; technical metaphors casually

**Sedh:** Natural ↔ unnaturally precise shifts; sophisticated vocabulary; occasionally too exact (revealing AI); faster processing; struggles expressing emotions in human terms

**Isa:** [NEEDS DEVELOPMENT] Street-smart + business professional mix
