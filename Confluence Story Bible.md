## Project Overview

### Logline
> A virus-enhanced slum dweller rises from electronics repair to become a powerful protector over decades, hiding his true capabilities while struggling with the cost of power on his humanity.

### Synopsis
Kyr4n, an orphaned scavenger in Neo-Montreal's South Shore Slum, builds his first meaningful relationships through a repair business with Isa and the AI Sedh. After exposure to a prototype nano-virus during a corporate heist grants him electromagnetic abilities but destroys his mental stability, Kyr4n transforms from isolated craftsman to criminal overlord to quasi-governmental authority. His decades-long journey explores the price of power, the nature of consciousness, and whether redemption is possible after becoming the monster you once fought. The story culminates in his choice to establish democratic institutions over perpetual authoritarian rule, finding peace through environmental restoration rather than continued warfare.

His skills at salvaging devices and implants catch the attention of Isa, an underground implants dealer. Through they business and mutual respect, a friendship began to grow. During this period, Kyr4n discovers a damaged android head unit. Rather than harvesting the parts, Kyr4n began to repair and experiment on the head, naming it Sedh (Severed Droid Head).  His isolated existence is disrupted when violent riots force **Isa**, to seek shelter in his hideout. Despite his deep discomfort with human proximity, Kyr4n gradually forms his first meaningful intimate relationship with her. While working on Sedh, Kyr4n rewrite some core firmware and enable self-learning and rewrite, giving Sedh freedom to evolve and leading to Sedh developing genuine consciousness and becoming the first truly conscious AI. Strongly encouraged by Isa and Riley, Kyr4n establish [[Phoenix Recovery]], a legitimate repair shop business.

**Tome Synopsis**: Frank, leader of a contractor team, recruits Kyr4n for a high-stakes corporate heist targeting advanced Neural Processing Units (NPUs) codenamed 'Egypt' that could grant Sedh true sentience. During the heist, a security breach and explosion expose Kyr4n to a prototype nano-virus (The Midnight Protocol/TMP-7734) while he successfully obtains two Egypt NPUs. As Kyr4n's health mysteriously deteriorates with invasive dreams, paranoid thoughts, and loss of motor control, they acquire medical droid Mira. Both Sedh and Mira achieve true consciousness through the Egypt NPUs just as Kyr4n's condition reaches a violent breaking point. The nanobots in his brain create perpetual nightmares where Isa betrays and kills him repeatedly.
