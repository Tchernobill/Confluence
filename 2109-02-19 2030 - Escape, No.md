# Full Scene Draft

## Part 1: The Setup (20:30)

Kyr4n was doing it again.

Isa recognized the pattern now—the way he'd suggested Riley choose the movie, then deferred to her choice when Riley said "whatever you want," landing them back at Kyr4n's original preference by pure accommodation. The way he'd positioned himself on the edge of the couch instead of in the middle. The way he'd offered to make popcorn, get drinks, check the inventory logs, anything to be useful rather than just present.

The way he was being so fucking careful.

She'd had two glasses of wine. Not drunk—not like yesterday—but enough to lower her inhibitions about calling him on it.

"Kyr4n."

He looked up from his data pad. "Mm?"

"Come sit here." She patted the couch cushion between herself and Riley.

"I'm fine here."

"I don't care. Come here."

A flicker of something crossed his face—surprise, maybe, or uncertainty. But he moved, settling carefully between them. Too carefully. Like he was afraid to take up space.

Riley draped an arm across the back of the couch, fingers brushing Kyr4n's shoulder. Natural and easy. Kyr4n didn't lean into it, but he didn't pull away either.

Isa studied his profile. The slight tension in his jaw. The way his hands rested on his thighs, precise and contained.

"You're doing it again," she said.

"Doing what?"

"Being too accommodating. Too careful." She shifted closer, deliberately invading his space. "Acting like you don't need anything."

"I don't need—"

"Bullshit." The wine made her bold. Or maybe she was just done watching him pretend. "You slept on the couch last night."

"You were in the bed."

"Our bed," she corrected. "All three of ours. You could have joined us."

Kyr4n's gaze slid away. "You were comfortable. I didn't want to disturb you."

"Disturb us." Isa leaned in, close enough to smell the faint electronics-and-soap scent of him. "Or avoid us?"

"Isa—"

"She's got a point," Riley said quietly. "You've been... distant today."

"I've been working."

"You're always working," Isa countered. "That's not new. But this—" she gestured at his careful positioning, his contained posture, "—this is you hiding."

Sedh's voice cut in from his position by the workshop door. "Isa is correct. Your behavioral patterns indicate withdrawal."

"Thank you, Sedh," Kyr4n said dryly.

"You are welcome."

Isa caught Kyr4n's chin, gently but firmly, turning his face toward hers. "Look at me."

He did. Those tired eyes, guarded and careful.

"You don't get to do that," she said. "You don't get to pretend you don't want anything. That you don't need anything. Because I know that's bullshit."

"I'm fine with—"

"With us being together without you? With sleeping on the couch? With being so fucking accommodating that you disappear?" Her thumb brushed his jaw. "No. I'm not letting you do that."

Something flickered in his expression. Not quite vulnerability, but close.

"I want you to be happy," he said quietly.

"I am happy." Isa's hand slid to the back of his neck. "But not if it means you're hiding. Not if it means you think you're—what, optional?"

His gaze dropped.

_Fuck._ She'd hit it exactly.

"Oh, Kyr4n." Her voice softened. "You idiot."

---

## Part 2: The Provocation (21:00)

"I'm going to prove something to you," Isa announced, finishing her second glass of wine and setting it down with deliberate precision.

"Prove what?" Kyr4n asked warily.

"That you're not optional. That you're very much wanted." She shifted, swinging one leg over his lap to straddle him. "That you're fucking desired."

Kyr4n's hands came up automatically to steady her. "Isa—"

"Shh." She leaned in, breath warm against his ear. "I'm talking."

Riley chuckled from his end of the couch. "This should be interesting."

"You—" Isa pressed closer, feeling Kyr4n's body respond despite his verbal resistance, "—are going to stop pretending you don't want this."

"I didn't say—"

"You didn't have to. You've been saying it all day with your body language." Her lips brushed his throat. "With your careful positioning. With your fucking couch sleeping."

"The couch was—"

"I don't want to hear about the couch." She nipped his earlobe. "I want to hear you admit you want this. Want us. Want me."

Kyr4n's breath hitched. His hands tightened on her hips.

"There," Isa murmured. "That's better."

"Isa." His voice had dropped, roughened. "Riley's—"

"Right here," Riley confirmed, clearly amused. "And enjoying the show."

"See?" Isa pulled back enough to meet Kyr4n's eyes. "No one's complaining. No one's uncomfortable. Just you, hiding behind your bullshit accommodating behavior."

"I'm not—"

She kissed him. Hard and deliberate, swallowing whatever protest he'd been forming. His resistance lasted maybe three seconds before he kissed back, one hand sliding up her spine, the other tightening on her hip.

When she pulled back, his eyes were darker, pupils blown.

"Yeah," she said softly. "That's what I thought."

"You're drunk," Kyr4n managed.

"I'm tipsy. There's a difference. I know exactly what I'm doing." She rolled her hips, feeling him hard beneath her. "Which is proving a point."

"What point?"

"That you're wanted. Actively. Specifically." She kissed his jaw, his throat. "That last night wasn't about you being optional. It was just about Riley and me having a moment. And tonight—" another roll of her hips that made him groan quietly, "—is about you having a moment."

"Isa—"

"Unless you're going to tell me you don't want this?" She pulled back, studying his face. "Because if you genuinely don't want this, I'll stop. But I don't think that's it."

Kyr4n's gaze flicked to Riley, then back to her. "I don't want to—"

"Impose?" Isa finished. "Take up space? Need attention?" She cupped his face. "Kyr4n. That's not how this works. We're not doing you a favor by including you. We want you here. Actively. Do you understand?"

Something in his expression cracked. Not quite breaking, but softening.

"I'm going to be very clear," Isa continued. "Tonight is about you. Your attention. Your pleasure. No accommodating. No being careful. Just you, getting exactly what you need. Understand?"

"I—" He swallowed. "Yes."

"Good." She kissed him again, slower this time. Deeper. When she pulled back, she glanced at Riley. "You joining?"

Riley stretched, deliberately casual. "Actually, I'm exhausted."

Isa blinked. "Really?"

"Really. Yesterday was... vigorous. And today was full of supply runs." He smiled. "Plus, I think Kyr4n could use some focused attention. Just from you."

"I did not think I would agree with Riley," Sedh interjected, "but I am also... tired."

Isa laughed. "You're tired?"

"From yesterday. The noise was substantial. I require recovery time."

"You don't sleep."

"I require processing time. Which is functionally equivalent."

"Besides," Riley added, kissing Isa's shoulder and then Kyr4n's temple, "you two should have your own time. Reconnect. Make sure this one—" he tapped Kyr4n's chest, "—stops being an idiot about being wanted."

Kyr4n's expression was difficult to read, but Isa caught the flash of something—gratitude, maybe, or relief.

"You sure?" she asked Riley.

"Completely." Riley stood, stretching. "I'm going to sleep on the couch, since someone has appropriated the bed recently."

"That was one time," Kyr4n muttered.

"I'm teasing." Riley's smile was warm. "Enjoy yourselves. Try to be quieter than we were yesterday."

"Statistically unlikely," Sedh observed.

"Thanks for the vote of confidence," Isa said dryly.

---

## Part 3: The Claim (21:30)

Riley disappeared into his quarters. Sedh remained by the workshop door, a silent witness. Isa returned her full attention to Kyr4n, who was watching her with that analytical expression he got when he was trying to process complex variables.

"Stop thinking," she said.

"I'm not—"

"You're always thinking. Right now, I want you to just feel." She slid off his lap, taking his hand. "Come with me."

"Where?"

"Bedroom. Your bedroom. Our bedroom." She tugged him up. "For your own personal little party."

"Isa—"

"Are you going to argue with me?" She pulled him closer, pressing against him. "Or are you going to let me prove exactly how much you're wanted?"

His breath caught. "The second one."

"Good answer." She started pulling him toward the bedroom.

As they passed Sedh, the AI tilted his head. "Enjoy your evening."

"We will," Isa said firmly.

"Kyr4n," Sedh added, and something in his tone made Kyr4n pause.

"Yeah?"

"You are not optional."

Kyr4n's expression flickered. "Sedh—"

"I am simply stating observed facts. You are wanted. Actively. Measurably. The data is conclusive."

Isa squeezed Kyr4n's hand. "See? Even Sedh agrees."

"Sedh always—"

"—tells the truth," Isa finished. "So maybe listen to him."

Kyr4n looked at the AI for a long moment. Whatever passed between them, it was enough. He nodded slightly.

"Now," Isa said, pulling him forward again, "stop overthinking and come with me."

The bedroom door closed behind them. For the first time in days, Kyr4n was the sole focus. Not the accommodation, not the adapter, not the optional angle.

Just wanted. Actively. Specifically.

The way he should have been all along.

---

## Part 4: Sedh and Riley's Conversation (22:00)

Riley emerged from his quarters in sleep clothes, heading for the couch. He found Sedh still positioned by the workshop door, optical sensors focused on nothing in particular—which meant, Riley had learned, that he was thinking.

"You're not actually tired, are you?" Riley asked.

"I do not experience fatigue as humans do."

"Yeah, I figured." Riley settled on the couch, pulling the blanket Sedh had apparently prepared. "You wanted them to be alone."

"Isa needed to address what she observed. I needed to not be present for the addressing."

"Because?"

"Because there are approximately thirty-seven viable sexual positions involving three participants, but only four involving two, and Isa's goals required reduced complexity."

Riley laughed. "Sedh, that's possibly the most clinical way I've ever heard someone explain 'they need privacy.'"

"I prefer precision."

"I know." Riley patted the couch. "Come sit. Talk to me."

Sedh moved to the other end of the couch, settling with that peculiar grace he'd developed. Not quite human movement, but close enough to be companionable.

"What did you mean earlier?" Riley asked. "About Kyr4n not being optional?"

"Precisely what I stated."

"Sedh."

"He believes he is the expendable variable in your relational configuration." Sedh's optical sensors focused on Riley. "He is incorrect."

Riley sat up straighter. "Wait. You think Kyr4n feels expendable?"

"I do not think. I observe. And the observational data is conclusive."

"What data?"

"Yesterday, he extended repair work by forty minutes to avoid joining you and Isa. His stated completion time was inaccurate. He possessed a valid excuse to decline participation."

Riley's stomach sank. "He was avoiding us?"

"Not precisely. He was facilitating your ease together without his presence. He perceived himself as the complicating factor."

"But that's not—" Riley stopped. Thought about yesterday. About how quickly Kyr4n had agreed to turn up his music, give them space, sleep on the couch. "Fuck."

"An apt summary."

"I thought he was just being considerate."

"He was. Excessively. To the point of self-erasure." Sedh's voice held something that might have been concern. "He slept on the couch not because it was convenient, but because he believed the bedroom belonged primarily to you and Isa."

"That's not true."

"Yet he believes it. Evidence: his positioning behaviors, his accommodation patterns, his tendency to create justification for his absence. He has constructed a framework in which he is necessary but not central. Useful but not desired."

Riley scrubbed his face. "How did I miss this?"

"You perceived his behavior as natural introversion and consideration. Which it partially is. But there is an underlying assumption he has made: that he is the weakest bond in your triad."

"He's not—"

"I am aware. You are aware. Isa is becoming aware. Kyr4n, however, is not convinced."

From the bedroom, muffled sounds. Not loud—Isa was apparently making good on the focused attention promise, but keeping volume manageable.

"He believes," Sedh continued, "that you and Isa fit naturally, while he requires integration. That you and Isa could function without him, but the reverse is not true. That his technical skills and intellectual contributions are valued, but his emotional and physical presence is optional."

"That's—" Riley couldn't finish. Because looking back, he could see it. Every careful positioning. Every quick accommodation. Every deflection of attention toward Riley and Isa's ease together.

"Fuck," he said again.

"Repeated apt summary."

"What do we do?"

"Isa is addressing it currently. Through direct confrontation and physical confirmation of desire. A valid approach, given her skill set and Kyr4n's tendency to believe actions over words."

"But that's just tonight. What about tomorrow? Next week?"

"You demonstrate, consistently, that he is not optional. That his presence is desired, not merely tolerated. That you and Isa choose him, actively, not because he is useful or accommodating, but because you want him here."

Riley absorbed this. "You really see all this?"

"I observe behavioral patterns. His are consistent with someone who believes they are tolerated rather than wanted. Despite clear evidence to the contrary."

"Evidence like?"

"Your physical affection, which is genuine and frequent. Isa's verbal affection, which is explicit and regular. The structural reality of your living situation, which integrates him fully. Yet he interprets these through a lens of accommodation rather than desire."

"Because?"

"Unknown. Possibly historical trauma. Possibly personality disposition. Possibly the fact that you and Isa do have natural chemistry that appears effortless, while his integration requires more deliberate bridging."

Riley thought about that. About how easily he and Isa fell into banter and physical affection. About how Kyr4n participated but often seemed to be translating, processing, choosing his responses with more care.

"He's not wrong about the effortless part," Riley admitted.

"No. You and Isa do have compatible communication styles and social preferences. But compatibility is not synonymous with superiority. Kyr4n's different approach is not lesser. It is different."

"But he thinks it is lesser."

"He fears it is. Which produces the accommodation behaviors. Which reinforce his perception. A feedback loop."

"How do we break it?"

"By refusing to allow his self-erasure. By noticing when he defers or withdraws or creates justification for absence. By actively pulling him in rather than passively accepting his positioning."

"Like Isa did tonight."

"Precisely. She refused to accept his accommodation. She demanded his presence and proved his desirability through direct action. This is effective for someone who trusts actions more than words."

Riley nodded slowly. "You've been thinking about this a lot."

"I have been observing. I care about Kyr4n. He created me. He is... important."

The simple statement carried weight. Sedh, for all his clinical language, genuinely cared.

"Thank you," Riley said. "For telling me. For seeing what I missed."

"You are not expected to observe everything. That is why you have me."

From the bedroom, a louder sound. Then Isa's laugh, warm and satisfied.

"She is accomplishing her goal," Sedh observed.

"Sounds like it."

"The decibel level is significantly lower than yesterday, however."

Riley smiled. "That's because she's focused. Not performing."

"Performing?"

"Yesterday was... enthusiastic. Fun. But also kind of performative, you know? Playing off each other's energy. Tonight's different. It's about making Kyr4n feel wanted. That's more intimate. More focused."

"Ah. I understand the distinction."

They sat in comfortable silence, Riley processing Sedh's observations, Sedh presumably processing whatever AIs processed.

"Sedh?"

"Yes?"

"You're good at this. The observation thing. The caring thing."

"Thank you. I am continually learning."

"Well, you're learning the right things."

The bedroom had gone quieter. Soft murmurs, occasional movement. The sounds of genuine intimacy rather than enthusiasm.

"They will be fine," Sedh said.

"Yeah." Riley settled into the blankets. "I think they will."

"Tomorrow, you should also demonstrate."

"Demonstrate?"

"That Kyr4n is wanted. Actively. Isa has established this through physical means. You should establish it through your own preferred method."

"Which is?"

"Steady presence. Verbal affirmation. Physical affection without agenda. The things you excel at."

Riley smiled. "I can do that."

"I know. That is why I suggested it."

"Thanks, Sedh."

"You are welcome. Sleep well, Riley."

"You too."

"I do not sleep."

"I know. Goodnight anyway."

"Goodnight."

Riley closed his eyes, already planning tomorrow. Ways to show Kyr4n he was wanted. Needed. Central, not optional.

Sedh had given him the framework. Now he just needed to execute.

The bedroom was silent now. Riley hoped Kyr4n was letting himself believe it—that he was wanted, desired, chosen. Not accommodated. Not tolerated.

Wanted.

Tomorrow, Riley would make sure he knew it too.

---

## Part 5: Morning After (08:30)

Riley woke to find Kyr4n in the kitchen, making coffee with more ease in his movements than he'd had in days. Isa emerged from the bedroom shortly after, wearing one of Kyr4n's shirts this time, hair wild but expression satisfied.

"Morning," Riley said.

"Morning." Isa accepted the coffee Kyr4n handed her, their fingers brushing in a way that looked natural, easy.

Kyr4n met Riley's gaze. Something in his expression had shifted—still contained, still careful, but less guarded. Less hidden.

"Sleep okay?" Riley asked.

"Couch was fine," Riley said.

"You shouldn't have to—" Kyr4n started.

"I chose to," Riley interrupted gently. "Because you needed focused time with Isa. That's not a problem. That's not you imposing. That's just... how this works sometimes."

Kyr4n blinked. Processed. Nodded slowly.

"Besides," Riley continued, standing and crossing to them, "tonight's my turn to make sure you know you're wanted."

"Riley—"

Riley kissed him, soft and deliberate. Not urgent like Isa's seduction, but steady. Affirming.

When he pulled back, Kyr4n's eyes had that slightly stunned look he got when emotions hit unexpectedly.

"You're not optional," Riley said quietly. "You're not the careful third. You're not the accommodation. You're wanted. By both of us. Actively. Got it?"

Kyr4n's throat worked. "Got it."

"Good." Riley grabbed his own coffee. "Now, what's for breakfast? I'm starving."

Sedh's voice cut in from the workshop. "I can prepare breakfast. I have been researching optimal nutritional combinations."

"You have?" Isa asked.

"Yes. Apparently yesterday's alcohol consumption requires specific recovery nutrition."

"Sedh, you're the best."

"I am aware."

Riley caught Kyr4n's eye. Saw the slight smile, the easing of tension that had been there for days.

Not fixed. Not completely. But better.

A start.

**END SCENE**

## Scene Notes

**What This Scene Accomplishes:**

1. **Isa's Active Intervention**: She refuses to let Kyr4n hide, directly confronts his "optional" positioning
    
2. **Focused Intimacy**: Giving Kyr4n solo attention (not triad, just him and Isa) directly counters his feeling of being third wheel
    
3. **Riley's Choice**: By bowing out deliberately (not tiredness, but choice), Riley gives Kyr4n space while also validating his importance
    
4. **Sedh as Truth-Teller**: Articulates to Riley what he's observed about Kyr4n's hidden feelings
    
5. **Riley's Growing Awareness**: He realizes he's missed important emotional dynamics
    
6. **Plan for Continued Support**: Both Isa and Riley now understand they need to actively demonstrate Kyr4n's importance
    

**Key Emotional Beats:**

- Isa's "You don't get to pretend you don't want anything"—direct confrontation
- Kyr4n's "I want you to be happy"—revealing his core motivation
- Isa's realization: "Oh, Kyr4n. You idiot."—she's got it
- Sedh's "You are not optional"—simple, direct, true
- Sedh to Riley: "He believes he is the expendable variable"—naming it
- Riley's commitment to demonstrating Kyr4n's importance

**Structural Function:**

This scene serves as the turning point where:

- Kyr4n's hidden feelings are exposed
- Both Isa and Riley become consciously aware
- Active intervention begins (not just passive acceptance)
- Foundation laid for healthier dynamic going forward

**Character Voice Consistency:**

- **Isa**: Bold, direct, refuses to accept bullshit, uses physicality to communicate
- **Kyr4n**: Verbal resistance masking genuine desire, "I'm fine" armor, careful positioning
- **Riley**: Perceptive once information is provided, chooses supportive action
- **Sedh**: Clinical precision serving emotional insight, dry humor, genuine care

The scene balances sexy/playful (first half) with serious emotional revelation (second half), showing how pleasure and insight can work together to address relationship dynamics.
