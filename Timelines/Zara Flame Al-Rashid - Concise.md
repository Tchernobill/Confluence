## Character State at Meeting Vyr4n

At age 19, Zara appears as a one-dimensional violent weapon:

- **Emotional Range**: Anger, cold calculation, occasional satisfaction from successful kills
- **Social Skills**: Minimal, views most interactions as potential threats or tactical opportunities
- **Moral Framework**: Survival-based pragmatism, loyalty only to immediate self-interest
- **Relationship Capacity**: Cannot form meaningful bonds, sees people as assets or obstacles
- **Violence Response**: First and preferred solution to most problems
- **Trauma Processing**: Completely suppressed, manifests only as hypervigilance and aggression

Her layered complexity, capacity for loyalty, and deeper emotional range will only emerge through prolonged exposure to Vyr4n's unusual leadership style and the organization's protective culture during Arc 4.
