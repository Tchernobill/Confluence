## Character State at Meeting Kyr4n

At age 16 (nearly 17), Isa has developed exceptional maturity through trauma and necessity:

- **Emotional Maturity**: Advanced due to loss and survival requirements, capable of adult relationships
- **Business Acumen**: Established dealer with 3+ years experience, reputation for quality and reliability
- **Social Skills**: Excellent people reader, natural negotiator, builds trust networks easily
- **Technical Knowledge**: Solid understanding of implants and electronics, eager to learn advanced techniques
- **Survival Instincts**: Street-smart and cautious, but willing to take calculated risks for meaningful connections
- **Relationship Capacity**: Craves genuine connection while maintaining independence, sees potential in broken things and people

Her combination of emotional intelligence, business sense, and genuine caring makes her the perfect complement to Kyr4n's technical brilliance and emotional guardedness. At 16, she's been independent for 4 years and operating as a professional for 3+ years, giving her adult-level experience despite her youth.
