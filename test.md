The door scraped shut behind them, the familiar drag of metal on metal sealing out the night's hum. Inside, the container was dim, lit only by a single low-wattage lamp Isa had left on—its warm glow casting long shadows across the rumpled bed and the scatter of her belongings. The air was thicker here, scented with sleep and the faint trace of her skin, a mix of soap and something uniquely hers that Kyr4n had come to associate with safety.

Isa released his hand but didn't step away, turning to face him instead. Her shirt hung loose, the fabric whispering against her thighs as she moved. She could feel the heat of his gaze from earlier still lingering, the way his eyes had traced her body out on the balcony—like he was memorizing her, not just looking. It stirred something low in her belly, a slow unfurling warmth that made her aware of every brush of cloth against her skin. [*He's still looking at me like that, even now. God, it makes me want him. Want to feel his hands instead of this shirt.*]

"Bed," she said softly, her voice carrying that same teasing edge from outside, but laced with something heavier now. Anticipation. She backed toward the mattress, pulling him with her by the front of his shirt, her fingers curling into the fabric. The backs of her knees hit the edge of the bed, and she sat, looking up at him with eyes that held no pretense. [*Come here, Kyry. Let me show you how much I need this—need you—right now.*]

Kyr4n followed, his movements deliberate, like he was processing each step. He knelt on the bed, the mattress dipping under his weight, and reached for her. His hands found her waist first, sliding under the hem of her shirt, palms warm against her bare skin. The touch sent a shiver through her, straight to her core, and she arched slightly, pressing into him. [*Yes, touch me. Higher. I can feel how much he wants this too—his breath's quicker, his hands trembling just a little.*]

She lifted her arms, and he understood without words, peeling the shirt up and over her head in one smooth motion. It fluttered to the floor, forgotten. Now she was bare before him, her skin prickling in the cool air, nipples hardening under his gaze. She didn't cover herself—didn't want to. Instead, she leaned back on her elbows, letting him see all of her, the curve of her breasts, the dip of her waist, the shadow between her thighs. [*Look at me. All of me. It turns me on, knowing you can't look away. My body's aching for you already—wet, ready.*]

Kyr4n's breath caught, his eyes darkening as they roamed over her. "Isa..." It was barely a whisper, reverent, like he was afraid saying more might shatter the moment. He leaned down, his mouth finding her collarbone first, lips brushing soft and tentative. Then bolder, trailing lower, until he reached the swell of her breast. His tongue flicked out, teasing her nipple, and she gasped, her hand threading into his hair to hold him there. [*Oh fuck, that's good. His mouth—warm, insistent. I can feel the heat building, pooling between my legs. More, please.*]

She pulled him closer, their bodies aligning as he settled over her, his weight a welcome pressure. Her legs parted instinctively, wrapping around his hips, drawing him in. She could feel him hard against her through his clothes, the friction sending sparks through her. [*He's so ready for me. I want to feel him inside, filling me, making me forget everything but this.*] Her hands tugged at his shirt, impatient now, stripping it off him with a low chuckle that turned into a moan when his bare chest pressed against hers.

Their kisses grew urgent, mouths open and seeking, tongues tangling as hands explored. Kyr4n's fingers traced down her side, over her hip, then between her thighs where she was slick and sensitive. He stroked her gently at first, learning her responses—the way she arched, the soft whimpers she couldn't hold back. [*Right there—yes, like that. He's so attentive, so focused. It drives me wild, how he watches my face, adjusts to what I need.*]

"Kyry," she breathed against his lips, her hips rocking into his touch. [*I need you now. All of you. No more waiting.*] She reached for his pants, fumbling with the fastenings, freeing him. He groaned as her fingers wrapped around him, guiding him to her entrance. With a slow, deliberate thrust, he sank into her, and she cried out softly, the fullness overwhelming in the best way. [*God, yes. He fits so perfectly. Every inch—stretching me, completing me.*]

They moved together, a rhythm that built like the night's earlier playfulness but deeper now, more primal. Her nails dug into his back, urging him on, her thoughts a haze of sensation and want. [*Faster—harder. I love how he loses control with me, that careful mind of his giving way to this. We're both so exposed, so raw. It's everything.*] The tension coiled tight within her, release crashing over her in waves that left her trembling, calling his name. He followed soon after, burying his face in her neck, his body shuddering against hers.

Afterward, they lay tangled, breaths slowing in the quiet. Isa traced lazy patterns on his skin, her body sated and soft. [*This... this is what freedom feels like. Naked, spent, and safe in his arms. I could stay like this forever.*]
