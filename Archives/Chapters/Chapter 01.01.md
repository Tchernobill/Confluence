## Text

Warm sunlight filters through leaves that dance in a gentle breeze, casting shifting patterns of gold and green across soft grass. The air carries the sweet scent of tomatoes ripening on heavy vines, their red globes hanging like promises against the verdant backdrop of raised garden beds that stretch beyond any slum dwelling's possibility.

Vyr4n—younger here, unmarked by the sharp angles of hunger and constant vigilance—kneels beside the neat rows where his mother's hands guide his own. Her fingers, warm and patient, show him how to test soil moisture with his fingertips, how to read the subtle language of plant health in leaf color and stem thickness.

"Everything has its own language, Vyr," she says, using the diminutive that only she ever dared. Her voice carries the infinite patience of someone who believes in teaching for its own sake, not just survival. "Electronics, plants, people—they all tell you what they need if you learn to listen."

The garden extends impossibly far—neat rows of vegetables, fruit trees heavy with produce, flowers that exist purely for beauty rather than function. Solar panels integrate seamlessly into trellises, powering small pumps that create the gentle sound of moving water. Technology and nature in perfect harmony, the way his mother always said it should be.

He breathes in air that carries the scent of growing things, of earth and sun and the promise that tomorrow will bring more abundance than today. His hands are clean, his clothes fit properly, and the knot of constant hunger in his stomach is absent—replaced by the simple satisfaction of good food eaten in safety.

"We'll expand the hydroponics next season," his mother continues, her face unmarked by the illness that would later consume her. "Maybe add aquaponics for protein. There's always room to grow, always room to improve."

The sun warms his shoulders as he works, and for this perfect moment, all of existence is this balance of human ingenuity and natural abundance—

*Drip.*

The sound intrudes like a discordant note in a symphony, pulling at the edges of his consciousness.

*Drip.*

Again, more insistent, carrying with it the metallic taste of contaminated water and the stale recycled air of underground spaces.

*Drip.*

The garden begins to fade at the edges, colors bleeding away like watercolors in rain. His mother's voice echoes one final time—"There's always room to grow"—before reality reasserts its claim with the subtle cruelty of truth.

Cold concrete presses against Vyr4n's cheek, yanking consciousness back with all the gentleness of a plasma cutter through flesh. The scent of growing things dissolves into the familiar cocktail of rust, mold, and industrial runoff that defines breathable air in the South Shore Slum's forgotten depths.

His eyes open to harsh LED light reflecting off walls that weep perpetual moisture—condensation that never quite freezes and never quite evaporates in the consistent chill of his concrete tomb. Two meters by three meters by two-point-one meters high. Dimensions burned into his muscle memory by months of careful navigation around hard edges and unforgiving surfaces.

The garden exists only in the afterimage burned behind his eyelids, fading even as he tries to hold onto its warmth. His mother's voice echoes for one more heartbeat before the present reclaims him completely.

*Drip.*

There it is again—the sound that pulled him from dreams. Water falling somewhere in the darkness beyond his workspace, each drop amplified in the confined space like a countdown timer measuring the distance between hope and survival. The sound has become part of his heartbeat, a rhythm he no longer consciously notices except when it intrudes on the rare moments when his mind travels elsewhere.

Vyr4n sits up slowly, joints protesting the night spent on a sleeping mat thin enough to feel every imperfection in the concrete beneath. The single LED bulb hanging from its frayed cord casts everything in stark white and black, washing color from a world that has little enough to spare.

His tool bench waits in the corner—salvaged metal surface covered with the ordered chaos of electronic components, each piece representing hours of careful scavenging from the slum's technological corpses. This is his mother's garden now: circuits instead of vegetables, data flows instead of irrigation, the delicate cultivation of function from components that others have declared dead.

The air carries its usual chill, seeping through his worn shirt and settling into bones that have grown accustomed to never being truly warm. He reaches for the thermal blanket that serves as both covering and privacy screen, wrapping it around his shoulders as he moves through his morning routine with practiced efficiency.

Water first. The condensation collection system has gathered perhaps half a liter overnight—plastic sheeting channeling moisture into a recycled container, filtered through salvaged industrial equipment that removes the worst of the contamination but leaves everything tasting faintly of metal and chemicals. He drinks slowly, rationing each sip while his body reminds him that eighteen-year-olds require more calories than seventeen-year-olds, and seventeen-year-olds needed more than he'd been able to provide.

Next, his mother's technical journals, wrapped in waterproof material and stored in the space's only truly secure location. The pages fall open to diagrams of hydroponic systems and sustainable energy integration—plans for the garden that exists now only in dreams and in the hopes of a woman who died believing her son might someday make them real. He studies a schematic for water purification systems while eating a nutrition bar that tastes like cardboard but provides the essential vitamins that keep scurvy and other deficiency diseases at bay.

Hygiene requires careful planning in a space with no running water and limited waste disposal options. He uses pre-moistened wipes to clean face and hands, changes his shirt for one marginally less worn, and makes mental notes about laundry requirements. Everything that goes out must eventually come back down through the vertical access shaft, creating logistical challenges that force careful resource management.

The tool inventory comes next—a ritual that serves both practical and psychological purposes. Each component gets examined, tested, organized according to function and condition. Capacitors, resistors, optical cables, neural interface components, power cells in various states of charge. Some salvaged from the daily scrap runs, others acquired through trade with the few underground dealers who recognize quality work.

By the time he finishes his morning routine, the LED light has been burning for an hour, draining precious power from his jury-rigged electrical connection. He switches it off and relies on the faint glow from his portable workstation as he prepares for the day's expedition to the surface.

The messenger bag gets packed with essential tools and a selection of components that might prove useful for immediate repairs. Emergency credits hidden in three separate locations, because redundancy matters when your entire financial security can disappear with a single mugging. His mother's multi-tool, weighted perfectly for precision work, slides into its familiar place at his belt.

The climb up the vertical shaft requires both physical effort and careful timing. Fifteen meters of corroded ladder rungs, each one tested before accepting full weight, while listening for sounds that might indicate human activity above. The grate at the top weighs nearly thirty kilograms, but he's learned to lift it with mechanical precision that minimizes both noise and effort.

Emerging into the slum's perpetual twilight feels like surfacing from deep water. The air here carries different contamination—industrial smoke, decomposing refuse, the constant background haze of human desperation—but it moves freely instead of pooling in stagnant chambers. He replaces the grate carefully, ensuring it appears undisturbed to casual observation.

The South Shore Slum spreads around him in familiar chaos. Makeshift structures built from shipping containers and salvaged materials create a vertical maze where the concepts of "street level" and "building" lose meaningful distinction. Power cables hang in dangerous tangles between improvised supports, carrying electricity stolen from corporate grids or generated by illegal fusion cells that could irradiate entire blocks if they malfunction.

Vyr4n moves through this landscape with the fluid efficiency of someone who understands its rhythms. He avoids the main thoroughfares where corporate security drones make occasional sweeps, instead following maintenance passages and emergency routes that most residents don't know exist. His feet find stable footing on surfaces that would challenge others, his ears automatically filter the constant background noise for patterns that might indicate threat or opportunity.

The first stop is Chen's food distribution point, a reinforced shipping container where the elderly man sells nutrition supplies to those who can afford them and provides basic meals to those who can't. The transaction is wordless—credits transferred via handheld scanner in exchange for a wrapped protein bar and a sealed water bottle. Chen nods acknowledgment, his weathered face showing the kind of weariness that comes from feeding people in a place where hunger is a constant companion.

"Morning, Vyr4n," Chen says, his voice carrying the careful neutrality of someone who serves the community without taking sides in its various conflicts. "You look like you actually slept."

"Some," Vyr4n replies, pocketing the food. "You heard anything about new corporate raids?"

"Nothing specific. But there's been chatter about increased security presence in the eastern sectors." Chen glances around, ensuring their conversation remains private. "Might want to avoid the usual salvage routes for a few days."

Information like this has value in the slum economy. Vyr4n files it away, adding it to his mental map of safe and dangerous territories that shifts constantly based on corporate enforcement patterns, gang movements, and the unpredictable variables of slum politics. He'll go north on his next run.

"Thanks for the heads up," he says, meaning it. Chen's price were considered higher than average, but reflected equally in quality and he often some useful info, as a 'post-sale consumer service'

The underground market occupies an abandoned metro station, its original purpose obscured by decades of improvised modifications. Vendor stalls built from salvaged materials line the former platforms, connected by walkways that span the empty tracks below. Emergency lighting provides illumination that casts everything in harsh shadows, while the constant background hum of electrical systems creates white noise that helps mask private conversations.

Vyr4n's usual spot sits in a corner where two support pillars create a natural alcove. The location offers good sight lines for security purposes while remaining discrete enough to avoid attracting unwanted attention from either corporate enforcement or slum predators. He sets up his portable workstation—a folding surface that expands to provide adequate workspace while remaining light enough to carry in his messenger bag.

The display of available services is deliberately modest. A hand-lettered sign advertising "Electronics Repair - Fair Prices - Discrete Service" along with examples of his work: restored neural interfaces, calibrated targeting systems, communication devices returned to functionality despite obvious damage. Nothing flashy enough to attract crowds, but sufficient to pull in a few customers per day. The more money he would make, the more of a target he would be.

Within minutes of setting up, the first customer approaches—a nervous woman clutching a damaged data pad whose screen flickers intermittently. The repair is routine: loose connection in the display cable, easily fixed with basic tools and five minutes of careful work. She pays the agreed price, relief evident as her device returns to full functionality. That was an easy 50ml of fresh water.

The morning progresses with a steady stream of similar work. Implant calibrations for clients whose enhancement software has drifted out of spec. Communication device repairs for underground dealers who need reliable equipment but can't afford corporate service contracts. A targeting system modification for a security guard whose employer provides substandard equipment but demands professional performance.

Each interaction follows similar patterns. Brief technical assessment, honest estimate of repair time and cost, careful work performed while the client watches or steps away for privacy. Payment in untraceable credits, no questions asked about device origin or intended use, the only thing that matter is the fix.

The clients call him "The Artisan"—a designation that emerged organically from satisfied customers and spread through the underground network of word-of-mouth referrals. What began as deep technical knowledge has evolved through practiced repetition into something approaching artistry, his hands moving by feel and intuition rather than mere methodology. He doesn't just fix things; he understands their deepest functions and guides them back to life with touches so precise they seem almost mystical.

By midday, his portable workstation shows signs of steady business. Several successful repairs, two ongoing projects that will require additional components, and enough credits earned to cover his basic expenses for the next week. Not prosperity by any measure, but survival with a small margin for unexpected opportunities.

He's recalibrating a neural interface that will require another hour of careful adjustment when she appears at the edge of his vision, a woman moving through the market with professional confidence, her attention clearly focused on something specific rather than casual browsing.

Vyr4n's hands continue their precise work while his peripheral awareness tracks her approach. Client assessment is automatic: practical clothing that suggests hands-on work, callused fingers indicating technical familiarity, the careful way she moves that speaks of someone accustomed to evaluating potential threats and opportunities.

She stops at a vendor stall two positions away, ostensibly examining salvaged components while her attention remains partially directed toward his workspace. Professional surveillance, but not hostile—more like someone conducting research rather than preparing for confrontation.

He completes the neural interface calibration, tests the adjustment with diagnostic equipment, and hands the device back to its owner with care instructions and a fair price. The satisfied client departs, and suddenly the woman's casual observation becomes direct approach.

"Most impressive performances improve with an audience," she says, stepping into his peripheral vision with the confidence of someone accustomed to making contact with strangers.

Vyr4n's hands still for just a moment—the only sign he's registered her presence. Professional assessment continues: mid-twenties, hazel eyes that miss very little, the kind of practical intelligence that suggests technical background rather than simple street survival.

"Wasn't performing," he replies, returning his attention to organizing tools while remaining aware of her presence.

"No, you weren't." She moves closer, studying his workspace with obvious professional appreciation. "That's what makes it impressive."
