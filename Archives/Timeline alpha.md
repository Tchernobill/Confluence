- As he move around the paralysed gunman, he explain that his main problem with him is his lack of manners. He point out to the other gunwoman that from a single look at her face, she doesn't like him either, but keep it for herself and dont act like she's his boss
- And since the crew is in Vyr4n's place, that make him the host, and as a good host, if the gunwoman would declare being thirsty, she would be entitled to a cold beverage from the fridge.
- Now, if the gunman were to declare being thirsty, the best he'd get with that rude attitude would be half a glass of warm water with some spit in it.

- Flux stay silent, as she's wondering how can he know about her dreams 
- He then start to talk about the progressively nightmarish effect of the virus, promising it's host something worst than death (this cue somehow shake Frank as he began to understand about Vyr4n)
- Vyr4n state that he suspect that Frank is going to Jerz because she's infected with DarkNight, a nanobot virus, and that there is a shady contact in Jerz that pretend he can cure it
- Flux want to know how he know, Vyr4n vaguely reply that he can smell it off her
- He put her hand into a device that seal over it, there is a pneumatic sound as a needle collect a blood sample
- He tell them that the Jerz contact is a scam, there is no cure and they will just take half of the credit upfront and either kill her if she's alone or sideline her long enough to be too late for her.
- While talking, he retrieve a box from a safe and put it next to the machine running the analysis

- He began to approach the bodyguard, his eyes and weapon locked on him, and asked "Any objections?"

- While exploring the structure of the whole criminal organisation, he conclude that it is a complexe and very efficient system to collect power (in the form of money, information, coercion, any kind of levage on others), but also a system that live and feed from other's suffering, creating and maintaining misery.
- The first display of this is how the street workers are threated, not like employees but disposable asset that degrade with 'usage' (violence, drug, living considions)
