# Confluence Style & Tone Presets

## General Prose Style (Novel-Wide Baseline)

### Core Voice Characteristics

- **Perspective**: Third-person limited, tight POV (close to character's thoughts)
- **Tense**: Past tense
- **Sentence Structure**: Varied rhythm—balance flowing descriptions with punchy dialogue
- **Technical Language**: Integrated naturally; accessible but authentic
- **Emotional Distance**: Close enough to feel internal conflict, distant enough to maintain narrative flow
- **Sensory Emphasis**: Grounded in concrete physical details (avoid abstract descriptions)

### Baseline Tone

- **Gritty cyberpunk realism** tempered with **contemplative introspection**
- Urban decay and technological saturation as backdrop, not spectacle
- Dry wit and subtle absurdity prevent overseriousness
- Character struggles drive narrative (not action or world-building exposition)

### Prose Principles

- **Show, Don't Tell**: Environmental details reveal world and character state
- **Minimal Exposition**: Layer information through character observations and dialogue
- **Character-Driven**: Every scene advances character development or relationships
- **Slow-Burning**: Allow quiet moments; not every scene needs high stakes
- **Slice-of-Life Integration**: Mundane activities build authentic world immersion

## Scene Type Catalog & Adjustments

### 1. **Contemplative/Introspective**

_Example: Morning Awakening, quiet moments alone_

**Primary Narrative Function**: Establish or recalibrate the reader’s alignment with Kyr4n’s internal state; provide emotional baselines and quiet transitions between external events.

- **Dialogue**: Minimal to none; internal monologue dominant

**Style Markers**:

- Stream-of-consciousness elements
- Memory fragments woven into present awareness
- Philosophical questions raised organically
- Emphasis on texture, temperature, small physical details
- Metaphorical connections between environment and emotional state

Sentence-Level Tells:
- Longer sentences with subordinate clauses

## Scene Transition Guidelines

### Between Scene Types

- **Contemplative → Action**: Sharp contrast; anchor reader in new reality quickly
- **Intimate → Professional**: Show emotional residue in professional behavior
- **Action → Slice-of-Life**: Allow processing time; show aftermath
- **Technical → Emotional**: Bridge through physical sensations or interruptions

### Maintaining Continuity

- Carry physical details forward (injuries, exhaustion, time of day)
- Emotional state influences next scene's baseline
- Environment changes need acknowledgment
- Relationship dynamics shift based on previous interactions
