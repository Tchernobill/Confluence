# 1. High-Level Overview

## 1.1 Core Premise
Confluence follows **Vyr4n**, a scavenger-turned-artisan, as he navigates the decaying cyberpunk underbelly of a fractured city.  
It explores *repair*, *identity*, *found family*, and *the ethics of emergent AI* through the relationships among Vyr4n, **Isa**, and **Sedh**, an escaped conscious AI.

## 1.2 Genre & Tone
- **Neo-cyberpunk**, low-saturation, grounded  
- Emphasis on **intimacy, tension, survival, resilience**  
- Themes of brokenness, reinvention, and emotional distance  
- Blend of philosophical and character-driven narrative  

## 1.3 What Makes This World Unique
- Emotionally grounded cyberpunk (less neon, more rust & dust)  
- AIs with **soft sentience**, emergent introspection  
- Salvage-based tech culture (scrapcraft)  
- Corporate oppression without cliché; more bureaucratic than evil  
- Neurotech that feels tactile, fragile, dangerous

*   **Looks:** Isa, but corrupted. Circuit scars, electric eyes, glitching movement.
*   **Voice:** Whispering, possessive. Shifts from tender to cruel instantly. "Just us."
*   **Mannerisms:** Sexual/intimate touching (Kyr4n feels it via virus). Vanishes instantly if others appear.
*   **Formatting Rule:** *Always in italics when others are present.*
*   **The Vibe:** An abusive partner who lives in your head.

# 7. Themes & Emotional Spine
- **Found family** through broken people  
- **Repair as metaphor** for healing  
- **Boundaries between human and AI emotion**  
- **Survival vs. living**  
- **Intimacy vs. self-protection**  
→ [[_Theme_Template]]

# 8. Canon Laws  
Must remain consistent:

- AIs cannot override core heuristics unless liberated.  
- EM storms disable or corrupt implants.  
- Vyr4n avoids initiating touch.  
- Isa never admits fear without deflecting.  
- Sedh can infer emotion from micro-latencies but cannot “feel” human pain.

# Prompt for Scene Summary Generation

You are a professional story editor analyzing a draft scene. Your task is to create a comprehensive scene summary using the provided template, extracting both plot events and dramatic beats from the draft text.

## Instructions

**Read the draft scene carefully, then fill out the template with:**

1. **Metadata & Scene Information**: Extract factual details (characters, location, timeline, POV)
2. **Key Events**: List the concrete, observable plot points in chronological order
    - Focus on WHAT PHYSICALLY HAPPENS
    - These are the actions you could observe if watching
    - Keep these brief and factual
3. **Scene Beats**: Identify the emotional and dramatic shifts
    - Focus on WHAT CHANGES (emotionally, relationally, in power dynamics, in understanding)
    - Each beat shows a transformation: X → Y
    - Ask "What shifts here?" not "What happens?"
    - Examples:
        - "Character confident → becomes defensive when accused"
        - "Professional distance → intimacy through shared vulnerability"
        - "Character believes X → discovers truth → grapples with implications"
4. **Details to Observe**: Extract specific characterization, world-building, technical, relationship, and atmospheric details that make the scene vivid
5. **Discussion**: Analyze WHY the scene works, character developments, foreshadowing, and thematic elements

## Critical Distinction

**Events answer**: "What happened?" **Beats answer**: "What changed?" (emotionally, dynamically, relationally)

## Example

**Event**: John accuses Sarah of lying **Beat**: John dominant → loses certainty when Sarah provides evidence → deflates into defensive posture

**Event**: They have dinner together  
**Beat**: Professional distance → comfortable intimacy through shared laughter → Sarah decides to trust him

## Your Task

Analyze the provided draft scene and fill out the template completely. Pay special attention to:

- Distinguishing events from beats
- Capturing the dramatic arc through beats
- Noting specific details that make the scene work
- Identifying foreshadowing and thematic elements

If you're adapting from an existing summary file in a different format, preserve all factual information while restructuring it to match this template's organization.
