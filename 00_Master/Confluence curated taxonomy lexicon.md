Below is a **curated taxonomy** of **-ence / -ance nouns** that fit your requested semantic field. I’ve filtered aggressively for *process*, *directionality*, and *non-instant causation*—words that imply systems moving rather than actions striking.

# Confluence Lexical Taxonomy

*(-ence / -ance nouns only)*

## Legend

* **Theme(s)** = which semantic axes the word activates

## Why this matters for *Confluence*

This lexical field:

* Reinforces **inevitability over choice**
* Makes **systems feel alive**
* Keeps violence *structural* rather than personal
* Supports themes of **AI emergence**, **networked identity**, and **found family**
* Allows emotional scenes to emerge *from pressure*, not melodrama
