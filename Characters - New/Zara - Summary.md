## Speech Pattern

- **Accent/Dialect:** Slight Middle Eastern accent that becomes more pronounced when emotional
- **Tone:** Low, flat, and almost monotone, but with a sharp edge. Rarely raises her voice unless truly angry.
- **Pacing:** Deliberate and controlled — she doesn’t waste words or speak quickly.
- **Word Choice:** Short, clipped sentences. Prefers blunt statements over explanations. Tends toward sarcasm, dry wit, and deadpan delivery.
- **Humor:** Dark, often violent in implication. Delivered with zero smile or change in tone, which makes it funnier.
- **Emotion:** Rarely shows vulnerability through her voice — even when upset, she sounds “hard.”
## Mannerisms

- **Facial Expression:** Almost always stoic, minimal expressions; when she smiles, it’s subtle and usually intimidating.
- **Posture/Body Language:** Confident, self-contained, slightly guarded. Arms often crossed, leans back rather than forward.
- **Gestures:** Rare, controlled, economical. Doesn’t fidget. When she moves, it’s intentional.
- **Eye Contact:** Steady, unblinking, sometimes unnerving.
- **Presence:** Gives off an aura of authority and danger despite saying little.
