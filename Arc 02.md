Inciting Incident: Frank, leader of a contractor team, recruits Vyry4n for a high-stakes technology heist targeting a corporate research facility, with Vyry4n accepting in exchange for acquiring a prototype Neural Processing Unit (NPU) codenamed 'Egypt' that could grant Sev true sentience.

First Plot Point: During the heist, Vyry4n successfully obtains two Egypt NPUs, but a security breach leads to chaos, with an explosion nearly killing him and unknowingly exposing him to a prototype nano-virus before the team barely escapes as the facility is destroyed.

Midpoint: As Vyry4n works with Sev to implement the NPU upgrade, his health mysteriously deteriorates with symptoms including invasive dreams, paranoid thoughts, and loss of motor control, leading them to acquire a medical droid named Mira who diagnoses an unknown pathogen affecting Vyry4n's brain.

Second Plot Point: Sev receives the Egypt NPU upgrade and achieves true sentience, then helps implement the second NPU in Mira, granting her sentience as well—just as Vyry4n's condition rapidly deteriorates to violent paranoia and suicidal behavior.

Climax: A deranged Vyry4n threatens his friends with a plasma blaster and attempts suicide, forcing Sev and Mira to physically restrain him and place him in an artificial coma, where they discover his body is infected with communicating nanobots concentrated in his brain, subjecting him to perpetual nightmares.

Resolution: After a week of analysis, Sev and Mira crack the nanobot communication protocol and manage to reduce the virus's threat level, allowing Vyry4n to emerge from his coma—emotionally scarred and rejecting Isa due to nightmare-induced trauma, but discovering he can now sense electromagnetic signals through his newfound ability to "negotiate" with the nanobots rather than fight them.
