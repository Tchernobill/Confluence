## Arc 02 Summary

**Inciting Incident**: Frank, leader of a contractor team, recruits Vyry4n for a high-stakes technology heist targeting a corporate research facility, with Vyry4n accepting in exchange for acquiring a prototype Neural Processing Unit (NPU) codenamed 'Egypt' that could grant Sedh true sentience.

**First Plot Point**: During the heist, Vyry4n successfully obtains two Egypt NPUs, but a security breach leads to chaos, with an explosion nearly killing him and unknowingly exposing him to a prototype nano-virus before the team barely escapes as the facility is destroyed.

**Midpoint**: As Vyry4n works with Sedh to implement the NPU upgrade, his health mysteriously deteriorates with symptoms including invasive dreams, paranoid thoughts, and loss of motor control, leading them to acquire a medical droid named Mira who diagnoses an unknown pathogen affecting Vyry4n's brain.

**Second Plot Point**: Sedh receives the Egypt NPU upgrade and achieves true sentience, then helps implement the second NPU in Mira, granting her sentience as well—just as Vyry4n's condition rapidly deteriorates to violent paranoia and suicidal behavior.

**Climax**: A deranged Vyry4n threatens his friends with a plasma blaster and attempts suicide, forcing Sedh and Mira to physically restrain him and place him in an artificial coma, where they discover his body is infected with communicating nanobots concentrated in his brain, subjecting him to perpetual nightmares.

**Resolution**: After a week of analysis, Sedh and Mira crack the nanobot communication protocol and manage to reduce the virus's threat level, allowing Vyry4n to emerge from his coma—emotionally scarred and rejecting Isa due to nightmare-induced trauma, she leave him. Later, he discover he can now sense electromagnetic signals through the nanobots's interface in his head.

## Arc 02 Chapters

### Chapter 7: The Proposition

End with Vyry4n reluctantly agreeing to Frank's heist proposal after seeing the technical specifications of the Egypt NPU, whispering to himself, "This could change everything for Sedh," as Frank smiles and extends his hand.
### Chapter 8: Infiltration

End with Vyry4n successfully pocketing the two Egypt NPUs, feeling triumphant, when suddenly alarms blare and Frank yells, "We've got company!" as security forces appear at the end of the corridor.
### Chapter 9: Escape

End with Vyry4n dazed on the floor after the explosion, vision blurry, seeing Frank drop the DeathPack with its countdown timer and abandon him, the numbers rapidly decreasing as Vyry4n struggles to move.
### Chapter 10: Symptoms

End with Vyry4n working on implementing the NPU in Sedh when suddenly his hand begins to tremble uncontrollably, tools clattering to the floor as his vision distorts and a voice he doesn't recognize whispers in his mind.
### Chapter 11: Deterioration

End with Mira running a diagnostic scan on Vyry4n, her expression changing as she reviews the results, turning to Sedh to say, "This isn't a normal illness. There's something artificial in his neural patterns—it's... replicating."
### Chapter 12: Awakening

End with Sedh opening his eyes after the Egypt NPU integration, experiencing a flood of new sensations and awareness, saying, "I can see... everything," while in the background, unnoticed, Vyry4n stumbles toward the weapons locker with a vacant, predatory expression.
### Chapter 13: Breaking Point

End with Vyry4n pressing the plasma blaster against his temple, finger on the trigger, screaming incoherently as Sedh and Mira exchange a silent communication and prepare to lunge at him from opposite sides.
### Chapter 14: The Signal

End with Vyry4n restrained and sedated, Sedh detecting the faint encrypted signal emanating from his body, turning to Mira with shock: "He's not infected. He's being transformed. Something is using his brain as a network."
### Chapter 15: Nightmare Protocol

End with Sedh and Mira finally breaking the encryption and seeing the true nature of the nano-virus, just as the monitors show Vyry4n's brain activity spiking dangerously, his body convulsing against the restraints, and his lips forming words: "Don't..."
### Chapter 16: Awakening

End with Vyry4n regaining consciousness, immediately recoiling from Isa's touch, eyes haunted by horrors only he has seen. Hurt by his distance and rejection, she leave him. Later, he notice he can somehow "feel" the electrical systems in the room—sensing and the droids for the first time the invisible data streams flowing through the interface with the nanobots.
