## Routine

He usually wake-up between 11am and 12pm.
He go downstairs and settle with his tablet, in his spot on the couch.
He will stay there and watch videos on Youtube Kids for most of the day.
He take breaks once in a while to play with other toys, often lego.
When the weather is good, he sometime take a peek in the backgarden or like to go to the park.
Overall, he spend approximatively 10-11 hours on his Android tablet.
During the day, all demands are avoided, he is bring dress, food is being provided (often at his request), he doesnt have any chores to do. The only demand he receive is to eat his dinner (no issues since it is at his pace) and at around midnight to go to bed.


## Meltdown

Meltdown usually contain self-harm or harm to others, violence include verbal agression, throwing or breaking what is within reach, spitting, pinching, kicking, punching, screaming, screeching, some minor bitting. He sometime need to be physically contained to prefent harm.


## Some behaviour examples

- Have a hard time resisting throwing things out the first floor windows (we need to keep them locked) or over the neigbors wall. He also smashed eggs or tub of creams at the grocerie.
- Enjoy pranks and tickles but have much difficulties understanding limits and boundaries.
- Verbally stim most of the day (and loud), often replaying scenes of cartoon he saw on his tablet, or will produce what seem to be random noise but are actually sound effect for a scene replaying in his head.
- Ocassionally leave the couch and his tablet and pace up and down the house, stimming more.
- His capacity to cope with changes or unplanned events have being diminishing over the last 12 months.
- Lashing out verbally and physically (outside of a meltdown) have increasing a lot in the last few months.
- He like to go to a park where there is a big rocket slide. He like to go and stay into the upper section. He used to be fine with the company of other kids in the upper section, but the last few time he was not confortable. In his last visit, he took the mobile phone of a teen and thrown it out the upper section. A few minutes minutes later, he violently screamed at a 5y old girl that was comming up the slide. Concern by his escalating distress and other kids wellbeing, we opt to leave the park, which triggered a meltdown.

chronic state of distress

## Clinical Assessment Summary: Ryan

### **Demographics & Background**
**Age:** 12 years  
**Location:** Dublin, Ireland  
**Primary Diagnoses:** Autism Spectrum Disorder with Pathological Demand Avoidance (PDA) profile  
**Current Support Level:** Requires extensive daily accommodation and supervision

---

### **Current Functional Capacity**

**Sleep-Wake Cycle:**
- Wake time: 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM
- Sleep initiation: ~2:00 AM following extended bedtime negotiations
- Severely disrupted circadian rhythm

**Daily Activity Pattern:**
- 10-11 hours daily screen engagement (Android tablet - YouTube Kids, games)
- Primary location: Designated spot on living room couch
- Brief diversions: Lego play, occasional outdoor activity (weather dependent)
- Minimal physical activity or environmental exploration

**Demand Management:**
- Near-complete demand avoidance successfully implemented by family
- Parents provide: dressing assistance, meal delivery, household management
- Tolerated demands: Self-paced dinner consumption
- Problematic demand: Bedtime transition (significant resistance and escalation)

---

### **Behavioral Presentations**

**Baseline Stimming Behaviors:**
- Continuous vocal stimming throughout waking hours
- Content: Cartoon scene repetition, sound effects, internal narrative vocalization
- Volume: Loud with apparent lack of self-monitoring
- Intensity increases during pacing episodes

**Regulatory Behaviors:**
- Daily pacing episodes: Walking back and forth through house
- Increased stimming during pacing periods
- Appears to serve arousal regulation function

**Impulse Control Challenges:**
- Compulsive throwing behaviors: objects from first-floor windows, items over neighbors' walls
- Public incidents: Destroying products in grocery stores (eggs, cream containers)
- Safety concerns requiring environmental modifications (locked windows)

**Social Interaction Difficulties:**
- Enjoys physical play (pranks, tickling) but struggles with boundary recognition
- Limited understanding of others' comfort levels or consent

---

### **Crisis Behaviors & Meltdowns**

**Meltdown Characteristics:**
- **Physical aggression:** Hitting, kicking, punching, pinching, minor biting
- **Self-directed harm:** Various self-injurious behaviors
- **Environmental aggression:** Throwing/breaking accessible objects
- **Verbal aggression:** Screaming, screeching, verbal threats
- **Other behaviors:** Spitting
- **Intervention required:** Physical containment to prevent harm

**Trigger Patterns:**
- Primary: Bedtime boundary enforcement
- Secondary: Unexpected departures or environmental changes
- Tertiary: Social pressure or proximity to other children

---

### **Clinical Trajectory (12-Month Period)**

**Deteriorating Areas:**
- **Adaptability:** Markedly decreased tolerance for changes or unplanned events
- **Aggression frequency:** Increased lashing out outside formal meltdown episodes
- **Social functioning:** Regression in peer tolerance and appropriate social responses
- **Sleep regulation:** Progressive worsening of bedtime resistance

**Recent Concerning Incidents:**
- Park aggression: Threw teenager's mobile phone from playground equipment
- Verbal aggression toward younger child (5-year-old) at playground
- Escalating distress requiring early departure from previously enjoyed activities

---

### **Clinical Assessment**

**Current Status:** Severe nervous system dysregulation despite minimal environmental demands

**Key Concerns:**
- Extreme demand sensitivity with comprehensive avoidance pattern
- Chronic sleep cycle disruption
- Progressive deterioration in adaptive functioning
- Escalating aggressive episodes
- Potential underlying medical/neurological contributors

**Immediate Needs:**
- Comprehensive medical evaluation to rule out pain, GI issues, or neurological factors
- Sleep study consideration
- Specialized autism/PDA consultation
- Crisis management planning for escalating behaviors

**Clinical Significance:** Ryan's presentation suggests complexity beyond typical PDA requiring multidisciplinary medical and behavioral intervention.
