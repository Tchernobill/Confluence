# MULTI-PROTAGONIST STRUCTURE: KEIRO AS THE CONSTANT

*A century-spanning narrative where Keiro Nakamura exists as a recurring secondary character, viewed through the eyes of different protagonists across seven distinct eras*

## NARRATIVE STRUCTURE OVERVIEW

**The Concept**: Each "book" or major section follows a different protagonist whose life intersects with Keiro during specific phases of his evolution. Keiro becomes a mysterious, evolving figure whose true nature is gradually revealed across multiple perspectives.

**Advantages of This Approach**:
- Readers discover Keiro's story pieced together through others' experiences
- Each protagonist can represent different aspects of their era's society
- Keiro's moral ambiguity is enhanced by showing different viewpoints of his actions
- Allows exploration of how the same person can be hero to some, villain to others
- The cyberpunk-to-solarpunk transition is shown through changing protagonist types
