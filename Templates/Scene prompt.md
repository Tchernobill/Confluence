For each task, refer to the available story material and project structure.

    Use the global outline in /Story/Arc [X]/[Arc [X] - Title of the arc].md to understand the full arc context.
    Use the chapter file (e.g., /Story/Arc [X]/[Arc no].[Chapter no] - Title of the chapter].md) to understand the chapter's goal, tone, and pacing.
    Use the scene file (e.g., /Story/Arc [X]/0[X].0[X].0[X].md') to understand the scene goal, tone and pacing.
    The text of a scene is in file (e.g., /Story/Arc [X]/0[X].0[X].0[X] - [Title of the scene].md) to understand the scene goal, tone and pacing.

    Integrate character actions and motivations using their profiles from /Characters/.
    Embed world details as needed from /Lore/.

🧠 Guidance for Consistency

    Match character behavior and development with their sheets.
    Maintain tonal and thematic continuity across the arc.
    Ensure location, social norms, and technology/magic are consistent with lore.
    Use prior events from previous scenes or chapters to inform continuity.
    If introducing new details or callbacks, consider potential setups for future arcs (marked with (foreshadowing)).
    Maintain structural clarity and narrative flow as per the scene template.
    Ask questions before proceeding if there is any ambiguity or missing elements.
