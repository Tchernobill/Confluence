## Draft Text

Isa navigates the crowded underground market with purpose, but not the usual kind. She's told herself this is about business—checking on potential component sources, maintaining her dealer network. But honesty forces her to admit she's curious about the enigmatic craftsman who accomplished the impossible with her damaged implant.

There's something about Kyr4n that intrigues her beyond his technical skills. In a world where rudeness passes for strength and cruelty for competence, his quiet politeness stands out like a rare component in a pile of scrap. He'd treated her with professional respect, delivered exactly what he promised, and asked no invasive questions about the obviously military-grade data he'd recovered.

In the South Shore Slum, such restraint qualifies as practically exotic.

She spots his corner stall through the hanging cables and salvaged equipment, but something's wrong. A crowd has formed in a rough circle, the kind that gathers when violence is about to happen. At the center, Kyr4n sits calmly at his workbench while a massive figure in corporate enforcement gear looms over him.

"You hear me talking to you, scav?" The enforcer's voice carries the mechanical amplification of throat mods, making each word boom across the market space. Corporate insignia marks him as private security—the worst kind, with legal immunity and a quota to fill.

Kyr4n doesn't look up from the neural interface he's calibrating, hands moving with the same precise motions Isa observed before. "I hear you. I'm choosing not to engage."

"Choosing?" The enforcer laughs, a sound like grinding metal. "You damaged corporate property. Payment is due."

"I haven't damaged anything." Kyr4n's voice remains level, professional. "If you have a legitimate complaint, file it through proper channels."

The enforcer's massive hand slams down on the workbench, making tools jump. "I am the proper channel, scav."

Isa moves closer, pushing through the crowd. She recognizes the setup—corporate thugs manufacturing pretexts for shake-downs, targeting successful underground operators. Her hand drifts toward the shock baton at her hip.

Kyr4n finally looks up, and Isa sees something in his expression that wasn't there during their business transaction—a kind of tired resignation, as if this is a familiar script he's been forced to perform too many times.

"What exactly am I alleged to have damaged?" he asks quietly.

"My partner's combat implant. Malfunctioned during a pacification operation last week. Traced the serial number back to your work."

"Serial numbers can be traced to original manufacturers, not repair work." Kyr4n stands slowly, and Isa realizes he's considerably smaller than the enforcer—lean where the other man is bulky, precise where the enforcer is crude. "If there was a malfunction, it wasn't related to any work I performed."

"You calling me a liar?"

"I'm calling you misinformed."

The enforcer's face darkens. "Stand up."

"I am standing."

"Stand up like you mean it."

Kyr4n tilts his head slightly, as if processing an unusual technical problem. "I'm not sure how one stands with greater or lesser intentionality. Could you be more specific?"

The first punch comes without warning—a massive armored fist that should have shattered Kyr4n's jaw. Instead, he moves with liquid precision, letting the blow graze past his cheek while stepping inside the enforcer's reach.

What follows looks less like a fight than a demonstration in applied physics. The enforcer has size, armor, and enhanced strength. Kyr4n has geometry, timing, and what appears to be supernatural understanding of mechanical systems.

A second punch catches him in the ribs, and Isa hears the impact—a sound like meat hitting concrete. Kyr4n staggers but doesn't fall, instead flowing around the enforcer's bulk like water around a stone. The third blow connects with his shoulder, spinning him halfway around and drawing a wince that makes Isa's hand tighten on her weapon.

She's wanted to intervene but a shock baton against this guy would be equivalent to slapping the ass of a rhino.

The enforcer grabs Kyr4n's head with both massive hands, lifts the smaller man off his feet, and brings his armored knee up for what should be a skull-crushing blow.

Kyr4n turns his head sideways at the last instant, protecting his nose, and his hands move with surgical precision. One grabs the enforcer's raised leg just above the knee joint. The other produces a pointed screwdriver that seems to materialize from nowhere.

The screwdriver disappears into the gap between armor plates with a soft _click_ of severed connections. The enforcer's leg servo whines in protest, then goes silent. Hydraulic fluid begins to leak in a thin stream.

Without the mechanical assistance, the enforcer's own weight works against him. Kyr4n shifts his grip, uses the bigger man's momentum, and suddenly three hundred pounds of armored thug crashes to the concrete with a sound like a dropped engine block.

The market goes silent.

Kyr4n kneels beside the fallen enforcer, just outside arm's reach, his movements calm and deliberate. From somewhere in his clothing, he produces a weapon Isa recognizes with a chill—a PitBull MKIII, compact enough to conceal in a palm but capable of punching through military-grade armor with its single shot. "Because you only need one shot" says the slogan.

"It looks like I brought more than a screwdriver to this fight."

The enforcer stares up at the small black cylinder pointed at his face, his own enhanced reflexes useless with one leg's servo system disabled. For several seconds, the only sound is the distant drip of hydraulic fluid and the enforcer's amplified breathing.

"Is this how you imagined it? Your end? Answer the question! This is how you saw your death?"

The enforcer, enraged, powerless, humiliated, stays silent.

Kyr4n's expression never changes—no anger, no satisfaction, just the same professional focus he brings to repairing damaged electronics. Finally, he stands and slides the weapon back into concealment with the same fluid motion that produced it.

"Your partner's implant malfunction was likely caused by incompatible firmware updates," he says conversationally, as if the violence never happened. "Corporate tech support should have caught that during routine maintenance. You might want to file a complaint with them instead. And if I were you... I'd find the answer to that question."

He turns and walks away, leaving the enforcer on the ground surrounded by a crowd that suddenly finds other places to be.

---

Isa catches up with him three blocks away, in a maintenance tunnel that connects to the main market complex. He's moving fast but not running, and she has to push to keep pace with his efficient navigation through the underground passages.

"Kyr4n, wait."

He stops, turning to face her with that same mild expression, as if the last ten minutes never happened. Only the slight swelling around his left eye and the careful way he holds his ribs suggest otherwise.

"Isa." He tilts his head slightly. "I thought I saw you in the crowd. Are you all right?"

"Am I all right?" She stares at him. "You're the one who just fought an armored enforcer with a screwdriver."

"I didn't fight him. I disabled a malfunctioning system." He resumes walking, though she notices he's favoring his left side. "The armor's knee joint had a standard servo array. Once you understand the mechanical linkages, interrupting the control signals is straightforward."

"That's not..." She struggles to find words. "You could have been killed."

"Possibly. But the probability was lower than it appeared." He glances at her. "Corporate enforcers rely on intimidation and overwhelming force. They're not trained to handle technical solutions to physical problems."

They walk in silence for a moment, the only sound their footsteps echoing off concrete walls. Isa finds herself studying his face in the dim light, looking for some reaction to what just happened—adrenaline, fear, satisfaction, anything normal.

"Does that happen often?" she asks finally.

"Corporate shake-downs? Every few weeks. Usually they're satisfied with a small payment and move on." He touches his ribs gingerly. "This one was more persistent than most."

"And you always handle them by..." She gestures vaguely.

"By understanding systems and exploiting their weaknesses? When necessary." He stops at an intersection of tunnels, considering his route. "Violence is just another technical problem. Input, processing, output. Most people treat it as emotional expression instead of mechanical process."

"That's a terrifying way to think about it."

"Is it?" He looks genuinely curious. "I find it comforting. Emotions are unpredictable, hard to debug. Mechanical systems follow rules. Even human bodies follow rules, if you understand the engineering."

Isa realizes she's seeing something most people never witness—the analytical mind that makes him exceptional at repair work applied to a very different kind of problem. It should disturb her more than it does.

"The weapon," she says. "PitBull MKIII. Those aren't standard market items."

"No, they're not." His tone doesn't invite further questions.

"Where did you—"

"The same place I get most of my tools. I find them, repair them, make them functional again." He meets her eyes directly. "Everything deserves a second chance to work properly."

They emerge from the tunnel system into an alley she doesn't recognize, several blocks from the market. The transition from underground to surface feels jarring after the violence and strange intimacy of their conversation.

"Why didn't you just pay him?" she asks. "A small bribe would have been cheaper than medical treatment."

"Because it wouldn't have been the last time." He adjusts his messenger bag, checking that his tools survived the confrontation. "Systems that receive positive feedback for malfunctioning will continue to malfunction. Better to debug the problem properly."

"By jamming a screwdriver into someone's knee."

"By interrupting the feedback loop that reinforced the problematic behavior." He almost smiles. "Though I admit the implementation was more direct than my usual debugging methods."

Isa finds herself laughing despite everything—a short, surprised sound. "You're absolutely insane, you know that?"

"I've been told my approach to problem-solving is unconventional." Now he does smile, just slightly. "But it works."

"This time it worked. Next time they might send someone without mechanical augmentation."

"Then I'll adapt my debugging approach accordingly." He pauses. "Was there something you needed? Beyond witnessing my unconventional conflict resolution methods?"

The question reminds her why she came looking for him in the first place. She reaches into her jacket and produces a small case, similar to the one that held her damaged implant but larger.

"I acquired some components I thought you might appreciate," she says. "Premium grade, difficult to source through normal channels."

He accepts the case and opens it carefully. Inside, nestled in protective foam, are three neural interface chips that make his eyebrows rise slightly—the first strong emotion she's seen from him all day.

"These are military grade. Current generation." He looks up at her. "How did you—"

"I have sources who prefer not to ask questions, as long as the payment is fair." She watches his expression. "I thought someone with your skills deserved better tools than salvaged scrap."

He lifts one of the chips carefully, examining it in the alley's dim light. For a moment, his professional facade cracks, revealing something like wonder beneath.

"These would improve processing speed by thirty percent. Maybe forty if properly integrated." He looks at her again. "Why?"

"Because watching you work yesterday was like watching art. And art requires quality materials."

The compliment seems to surprise him more than the enforcer's punches did. He carefully replaces the chip and closes the case.

"What's the arrangement?" he asks. "Commission-based supply? Exclusive dealing?"

"Nothing formal yet. Consider it an investment in exceptional craftsmanship." She starts to turn away, then pauses. "And Kyr4n? Next time you plan to debug an armored thug with hand tools, maybe let me know first. I have equipment that's designed for that kind of technical problem."

"I'll keep that in mind," he says, and she thinks she hears genuine appreciation in his voice.

As she walks away, Isa finds herself replaying the last half hour in her mind. The precision of his movements during the fight, the casual way he'd produced a military-grade weapon, the analytical detachment with which he'd discussed violence as a technical problem.

Most people would find it disturbing. She finds it fascinating.

In a world where strength usually means brutality and intelligence means exploitation, Kyr4n represents something different—power applied with surgical precision, violence as a last resort rather than a first impulse, politeness in the face of aggression.

She's definitely coming back.
