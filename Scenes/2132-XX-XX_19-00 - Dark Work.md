# The Dark Work - Private Assignment

## Scene Draft (Third Person Limited - Zara POV)

---

The summons came through her neural implant—private channel, Kyr4n's personal encryption. Just three words: _My office. Alone._

Zara finished her training session with the latest recruits, wiped the sweat from her face, and made her way through Phoenix Rising's command center. The operations floor buzzed with preparation—ninety-six hours until Northside moved, and everyone felt the controlled urgency.

She palmed the biometric lock on Kyr4n's private office. The door slid open silently.

He stood at the window overlooking the slum sprawl, backlit by the filtered afternoon light struggling through the pollution haze. She'd seen this particular posture before—hands clasped behind his back, shoulders carrying invisible weight.

The door sealed behind her. Security protocols engaged—full privacy mode, no surveillance, no records.

They were completely alone.

Zara's mouth curved into a knowing smile. "Well, well. Private office, full security lockdown, just the two of us..." She leaned against his desk, letting her voice drop into playful provocation. "If you wanted quality time, boss, you could've just asked nicely."

Kyr4n turned. His face was serious. Not the cold precision of tactical planning—something heavier.

"I need your services."

The tone killed her playful mood instantly, but she couldn't help one more deflection. Old habit. "You kinky bastard." She pushed off the desk, grinning. "We're doing roleplay now? Should I call you 'sir' more often, or—"

"Zara." His voice was quiet but absolute. "I need to hire you."

The smile faded. She studied his face, reading the micro-expressions she'd learned over years of watching him. Jaw tension. Eye focus. The particular stillness that meant he'd already made a difficult decision and was now executing it.

Understanding crystallized.

"You're already employing me," she said, her voice dropping to professional register. "Bodyguard, remember? Why do you think I'm following you around everywhere like that?"

"Not as bodyguard." Kyr4n moved to his desk, activated the holographic display. Northside territory map appeared, tactical overlays showing the planned assault route. "There's a new angle we can play."

He pulled up five profiles. Five faces. The Northside Collective's leadership—the Five who commanded their territories through brutality and barely-contained rivalry.

"These five will be commanding the Greenfield operation," Kyr4n said, his voice clinical now. Professional distance from what he was asking. "If they were to become...indisposed...and I could acquire their personal comm units..."

He let that hang. Zara understood immediately—the tactical implications cascaded through her professional assessment.

"You hack their comms," she said slowly. "Take their identities. Issue false orders."

"Command chaos. Their forces fragment. What should take days collapses to hours." Kyr4n met her eyes. "It would dramatically reduce our potential casualties. Reduce engagement duration to mere hours instead of sustained combat operation."

Zara looked at the five faces. Ran the tactical assessment. "All five need to go down simultaneously. Or close enough that word can't spread."

"Within a four-hour window. Before they mobilize for the assault."

"That's tight." She studied the profiles, already calculating approach vectors, vulnerability windows, extraction routes. "Doable, but tight."

Kyr4n's hands rested on the desk. "I could hire someone from outside. I should hire someone from outside." A pause. "Absolute discretion and secrecy is primordial. But there's nobody I trust more than you."

The admission cost him something. Zara heard it in the slight roughness of his voice—this wasn't easy for him. Not the killing. Not the tactical necessity. But asking _her_ specifically, when he knew the risk.

She moved closer, studying the profiles with professional focus. "Parameters?"

"The commanders need to disappear. I need their personal comm units—intact, functional, with biometric access preserved." Kyr4n's voice was steady now, laying out requirements. "All other details are entirely at your discretion. Method, timing, sequence, contingencies—I trust your judgment."

"Body disposal?"

"Your call. Vanish them completely or stage it however serves the mission."

Zara ran scenarios. Five targets, four-hour window, need to preserve comm units and biometric access. Challenging but feasible. She'd done more complex operations with worse odds.

"I'll need full intelligence packages on each target," she said. "Daily routines, security protocols, known associates, vulnerabilities."

"Sedh is compiling everything now. You'll have complete profiles within six hours."

"Autonomous operation?"

"Completely. You determine approach, you execute, you extract. I want zero connection between this and Phoenix Rising official operations."

Zara nodded slowly. This was the other job. The one that didn't appear in organizational charts or tactical briefings. The dark work that made clean victories possible.

"Budget?"

"Whatever you need. Equipment, bribes, contractors—full discretion."

She calculated. "I'll need forty-eight hours for preparation, then the operation window. That leaves forty-eight hours buffer before Northside mobilizes."

"Acceptable."

Zara studied the five faces again. All brutal men. All architects of the suffering she'd witnessed in Northside territories. Cutter's scars came from these men's systems. Hundreds—thousands—had died or been broken under their rule.

Tactically necessary. Morally complicated. Professionally achievable.

"One question," she said quietly. "You asking me because I'm the best? Or because you know I won't hesitate?"

Kyr4n met her eyes. "Both."

Fair enough.

She turned back to the profiles, her mind already shifting fully into operational mode. Five targets. Four-hour window. Intact comm units. Zero connection to Phoenix Rising.

"I'll need—"

"Zara." Kyr4n's voice stopped her. Different tone now. Not tactical. Personal.

She looked at him.

"There's one more thing," he said quietly. "Above all other parameters. Above mission success, above tactical advantage, above every consideration."

He moved around the desk, close enough that she could see the genuine concern in his eyes.

"If you're anything less than confident it can work—abort. Immediately. Come back. No mission completion is worth risking you."

Zara felt something warm and complicated move through her chest. The absolutely deadly man who orchestrated Shore-wide strategy, who calculated in lives and territories, who made decisions that cost or saved hundreds—he was looking at her with undisguised worry.

"I'm always confident," she said, letting a hint of her earlier playfulness return. "It's my most charming quality."

"I'm serious." His hand moved to her shoulder. Not romantic. Not sexual. Just...connection. "These men are dangerous. Their security is professional. The operation has real risk. If anything feels wrong—anything—you walk away. Promise me."

Zara studied his face. The careful emotional control cracking just slightly. Showing her what usually stayed hidden—how much she mattered. How the calculation that balanced hundreds of lives couldn't extend to her.

She reached up, covered his hand with hers. "I promise. If I'm not confident, I abort."

"Your life is worth more than tactical advantage."

"I know." She squeezed his hand. "Because you just told me. Which means you actually care, under all that cold tactical brilliance."

A slight smile touched his mouth—barely there, but genuine. "Under all that sarcasm, you're a professional. I know you'll execute this perfectly."

"Damn right I will." Zara stepped back, shifting fully into operational mode. "But I'm going to need that intelligence package ASAP. And access to off-books equipment. And probably a few toys Jin hasn't shown the regular troops yet."

"Already arranged. Jin knows to give you anything you request, no questions."

"He's going to have so many questions."

"He'll keep them to himself."

Zara pulled up the profiles again, her mind cataloging approach options. "When do I start?"

"Forty-eight hours from now, operation window opens. Until then, prepare however you need."

"I'll need to disappear from visible duty. Can't have people wondering why the bodyguard isn't bodying or guarding."

"Already covered. Official story: you're running advanced reconnaissance on Northside positions. Only Marcus knows it's not true, and he won't ask questions he doesn't want answered."

Smart. Marcus understood there were operations he couldn't afford to know about. Plausible deniability for everyone except the two people in this room.

Zara studied Kyr4n's face. "You thought about this option before the council meeting."

"Yes."

"And decided not to mention it."

"Yes."

"Because?"

"Because this is darker than what we discussed publicly. And because the fewer people who know, the safer you are."

Zara nodded slowly. This was the real calculation—not just tactical advantage, but protection. Keep the dark work invisible so it couldn't touch her legally, politically, morally in anyone else's eyes.

"You're protecting me from the operation you're sending me on," she said quietly. "That's...complicated."

"I know." Kyr4n's voice was steady. "But necessary. Five assassinations prevent potentially hundreds of casualties. The math is clear. The morality is...less so."

"Lucky I don't lose sleep over morality," Zara said, though they both knew it was more complex than that. She'd chosen this life. Chosen this work. But that didn't mean it was simple.

"You do," Kyr4n said quietly. "You just hide it better than most."

Damn him for seeing that.

"Intelligence package," she said, redirecting. "Sedh compiling?"

"Should be ready in five hours."

"I'll review, plan, requisition equipment. Forty-eight hours preparation. Four-hour window execution. Twelve hours buffer for extraction and equipment disposal."

"And if something goes wrong?"

"Then I abort, disappear, and we execute the original plan without the assassination advantage." She shrugged. "Higher casualties, longer engagement, but we still win."

"I'd rather have you alive and accept higher casualties."

"I know. You already said that." Zara moved toward the door, then paused. "But for the record? Five brutal dictators who've terrorized their territories for years, whose deaths will probably save thousands of lives long-term? I can live with that moral calculation."

She looked back at him. "Question is—can you? Because you're the one making it."

Kyr4n was quiet for a moment. "I made harder choices before. I'll make harder ones after."

"Doesn't answer the question."

"Yes," he said quietly. "I can live with it. Because the alternative is worse. That's always the calculation—which option produces less suffering."

"And if the answer is 'murder five people'?"

"Then I order it, you execute it, and we both carry the weight." His eyes met hers. "Together."

Zara felt the intimacy of that acknowledgment. Not romantic. Deeper. Partnership in the dark work that kept everything else clean.

"Together," she agreed.

She palmed the door release, but Kyr4n's voice stopped her once more.

"Zara."

She turned.

"Thank you." Simple words, weighted with everything unspoken. Trust. Gratitude. Acknowledgment of what he was asking. Recognition of the burden.

"Thank me when I'm back safely with five comm units and zero witnesses." She grinned, recapturing some of the earlier lightness. "Then maybe we can revisit that roleplay conversation."

His mouth quirked—almost a smile. "Get out of my office."

"That's 'get out of my office, ma'am' to you, boss."

"Zara."

"Going, going." She slipped through the door, hearing it seal behind her.

The operations floor's noise hit her immediately—tactical discussions, equipment checks, logistics coordination. All the visible preparation for the operation everyone knew about.

Nobody looked at her differently. Nobody suspected what conversation just happened. Nobody knew about the dark work that would make their clean victory possible.

Zara moved through the crowd toward the armory, her mind already shifting fully into operational mode. Five targets. Forty-eight hours. Four-hour execution window.

Professional challenge. Morally complicated. Tactically necessary.

And somewhere under the cold professional calculation, a warm certainty: Kyr4n had trusted her with this because she was the only one he trusted with his darkest operations. That mattered more than she'd admit out loud.

She'd execute it perfectly. Come back safely. And carry the weight with him.

Together.
