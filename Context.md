## Core Themes
**Character-Driven Storytelling**
The narrative centre on the struggle of the characters and interactions among them. Their conversations, emotional journeys, and everyday exploits drive the story forward, exploring themes like mental struggle, personal relationship, isolation, and personal growth beyond the typical hero's arc.

**Worldbuilding Through Details and Atmosphere**
Instead of detailed explanations or expositional dialogue, the world is built through 'show dont tell', environmental details (e.g., descriptions of buildings and settings), character observations, and the protagonists everyday experiences. This organic approach immerses readers within the story's context without feeling the need to spell everything out overtly.

**Slow-Burning Storytelling**
Story span decades so it evolve slowly, favouring a more contemplative, observational pace. It contain frequent moments that focus on mundane activities or character interactions without significant plot developments. This deliberate unfolding of narrative allows for nuanced characterizations and thoughtful exploration of themes and relationships.

**Humorously Whimsical Tone**
To counterbalance it's darker tone, it balances its slice-of-life approach with dashes of dry wit, absurdity, and gentle humour. This tonal variety keeps the narrative light-hearted while still touching upon serious topics, preventing the story from feeling overly somber or preachy.
