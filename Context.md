## Genre/Subgenre
Semi-Cyberpunk with slice-of-life moment

## Core Themes
Character-Driven Storytelling The narrative centre on the struggle of the characters and interactions among them. Their conversations, emotional journeys, and everyday exploits drive the story forward, exploring themes like mental struggle, personal relationship, isolation, and personal growth beyond the typical hero's arc.
Worldbuilding Through Details and Atmosphere Instead of detailed explanations or expositional dialogue, the world is built through environmental details (e.g., descriptions of buildings and settings), character observations, and the protagonists' everyday experiences. This organic approach immerses readers/viewers within the story's context without feeling the need to spell everything out overtly.

Humorously Whimsical Tone To counterbalance it's darker tone, it balances its slice-of-life approach with dashes of dry wit, absurdity, and gentle humor. This tonal variety keeps the narrative light-hearted while still touching upon serious topics, preventing the story from feeling overly somber or preachy.

1. Character-Driven Storytelling: The narrative centers on the interactions among Frierien, a mighty mage; Heiter, a former adventurer turned baker; and their acquaintances.

2. Slow-Burning Storytelling: Beyond Journey's End eschews rapid pacing characteristic of many fantasy adventures in favor of a more contemplative, observational pace. Episodes often focus on mundane activities or character interactions without significant plot developments. This deliberate unfolding of narrative allows for nuanced characterizations and thoughtful exploration of themes and relationships.
