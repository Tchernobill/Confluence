**[Kyr4n'S LIVING QUARTERS - PHOENIX RECOVERY]**

---

Kyr4n sat with his back to the wall, knees pulled tight to his chest, staring at the hollow imprint where her travel bag had rested just that morning—as if the absence itself had weight.

The electromagnetic fields around him painted invisible maps of the room's electronic systems— the building's power grid threading through walls like luminous veins only he could perceive.

But the strongest signal came from beside him. Her bioelectric pattern.

A familiar warmth pressed against his left shoulder, steady and comforting. The scent of her hair, and that neural interface cleaner—that sharp, metallic tang she could never quite wash from her hands—drifted in the still air.

He didn’t dare look.
If he turned and there was nothing, it would break him.
If he turned and she was there—after all this—he wasn’t sure he could survive that either.
He kept his gaze low, fixed on the empty patch of floor.

She hadn’t said goodbye. Not really. Just a glance, a delay at the threshold. A flicker of hesitation that he’d chosen to ignore. He hadn’t asked her to stay. Couldn’t. 

"You understand, don't you?" he whispered to the wall. "Why I can't... why it has to be this way."

The sound of fabric shifting, soft breathing that matched the rhythm he'd memorized over countless shared nights. A presence that felt more real than the cold concrete beneath him or the ache in his chest where something vital had been carved away.

His enhanced senses detected the electromagnetic signature of her subdermal implants—the data ports along her spine, the neural enhancers at her temples. The same bioelectric pattern he'd learned to recognize from across crowded markets, the same gentle interference that made his new abilities sing with recognition.

If there was one thing he had learned in the last few weeks, it was this: reality was negotiable.

"I know you think I'm broken," he continued, voice barely audible. "Maybe I am. But I can still feel you. Right here. Right now."

The warmth shifted closer. Her hand—he could swear he felt her hand—resting on his arm with that specific weight and pressure he'd memorized. The way she always touched him when words weren't enough.

The presence beside him remained constant, electromagnetic signature steady and familiar. He closed his eyes and let himself believe in the lie that felt more true than the empty room around him.

"... I know"
