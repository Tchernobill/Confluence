Isa folded her last shirt into the travel bag with mechanical precision, each movement deliberate and final. Vyr4n stood in the workshop doorway, maintaining careful distance—close enough to seem present, far enough to avoid triggering whatever internal alarms still governed his nervous system.

Her bioelectric signature registered as a faint whisper against his enhanced senses, barely distinguishable from the workshop's background electromagnetic noise.

"Sedh and Mira can handle the technical aspects," she said without looking at him, discussing Phoenix Recovery's future like a business transaction. "Your client base trusts them almost as much as you now. The workshop protocols are established."

She paused, a data pad half-buried in her bag. "The financial arrangements are simple. I'll take my established clients, you keep the workshop and everything we built here. Clean separation."

Clean. Nothing about this felt clean.

"I don't want you to go," he said quietly, the admission scraping against his throat like broken glass.

Her hands stilled. For a moment, the careful composure cracked, revealing something raw and wounded underneath. "I know you don't. But look at us, Vyr. Look at what we've become."

He forced himself to meet her eyes, her face was real, present, familiar—but so had the dream-Isa been, right before the knife.

"You barely let me in the same room anymore," she continued, voice breaking slightly. "You watch me like I'm going to attack you. When I reach for something, you flinch. When I try to touch you..." She gestured helplessly. "The virus is neutralised, but whatever it did to you, whatever it made you see—that's still here."

"Maybe time—"

"Time isn't going to help." Her voice carried the weight of a decision already made. "I love you, I love you so much it's destroying me to watch you afraid of me."

She resumed packing, each item disappearing into the bag like pieces of their shared life being erased. "You need to heal. And I need... I need to not be the thing you're healing from."

The logic was flawless and devastating. "Where will you go?" he asked instead.

"I have contacts in Sector 7. Clean start, new clients. The guild will help with the transition." She sealed the bag and lifted it, testing the weight. "Sedh has my contact information if there are any business complications."

Business complications. As if their relationship was just another account to be transferred.

She walked toward him, and he fought not to step back. Stopped three feet away—close enough to acknowledge their connection, far enough to respect the invisible barrier that had built between them.

"This isn't forever," she said, though they both knew it was. "Maybe someday, when you're ready..."

"Maybe," he agreed, because hope was easier than honesty.

She moved toward the door, pausing at the threshold. "Take care of yourself, Vyr. Take care of Sedh and Mira. Build something beautiful here."

A glance over her shoulder—not quite meeting his eyes.

Then she was gone.

Vyr4n stood motionless in the workshop's electromagnetic hum, surrounded by the machinery they'd built together. After several minutes, he walked to his living quarters, sank against the wall, and stared at the empty space where her bag had been.

The absence had its own bioelectric signature. He could feel that too.
