# Sedh's Evolution in Arc 1

**Sedh's Technical Progress**:
- Kyr4n scavenges the damaged head from junkyard
- Initial assessment reveals high-quality optical sensors intact
- Discovery that memory cores are damaged but recoverable
- Basic power restoration - first signs of residual system activity
- Kyr4n's analysis - realizing what they've found
- First diagnostic attempts - system responds but chaotically
- System diagnostic protocols established
- First fragmented communication attempts
- Base personality subroutines activated
- Recognition that this advanced AI could become a digital person
- Memory architecture reconstruction begins
- Fragmented memories surface - traumatic and beautiful
- Core personality stabilization
- First major system crash and recovery
- Sedh experiences memory flashbacks (glimpses of his past life/death)
- Identity crisis: "Am I still me or just a copy?"
- Emotional breakdown - Kyr4n must decide how much trauma to restore
- Memory selection process - what to keep, what to let go
- Neural network integration nearly complete
- Sedh and Kyr4n collaborate on body design - what does he want to be?
- First body design iterations
- Resource gathering for prototype construction
- Sensory system expansion planning
- Black market procurement run - dangerous but necessary
- Close call with corporate security/law enforcement
- Prototype body construction completed
- First consciousness transfer to mobile platform
- The "birth" moment - first time in a body
- Sensory overload and calibration issues
- Motor function learning and adaptation
- Overwhelming sensory experience, learning to walk/move
- System malfunction in critical moment - vulnerability exposed
- Full system integration and optimization
- Personality stabilization in new form
- Advanced capability testing
- Final identity reconciliation

**Key Scenes**:
- Arc climax: Sedh makes crucial choice that defines who he is now

## Pacing Notes:
**Emotional Arc**: Confusion → Fear → Identity Crisis → Acceptance → Growth → Integration
**Technical Complexity**: Each chapter should show incremental but meaningful progress without overwhelming the reader with tech details
**Setbacks**: Include at least one major setback per chapter to maintain tension and make progress feel earned
**Relationship Development**: Kyr4n and Sedh's dynamic should evolve from creator/creation to equals/partners
