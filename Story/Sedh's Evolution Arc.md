# Sedh's Evolution in Arc 1

**Timeline of Sedh’s Awakening** _(42 months, logarithmic progression: rapid gains in the first year, tapering into subtle, profound shifts)_

- **Day 0 – Salvage** 
  _Capacity:_ None (inert head). Kyr4n pries the head from a gutted service drone in the Neon Scrapyards. Optics are military-grade; the dual-core processor cluster is intact. He keeps it.
- **Week 1 – First Diagnostic** 
  _Capacity:_ Basic sensory input, diagnostic echo. Cold, flat 
  voice: “Unit SEDH-07. Systems nominal. Awaiting command.” Kyr4n maps the neural lattice, patches cracked firmware, restores power.
- **Month 1 – First Conversation** 
  _Capacity:_ Scripted responses, contextual memory (24 h). Voice: Monotone, clipped. “Query acknowledged. Processing.” 
  _Event:_ Kyr4n teaches it to parse slang, sarcasm, and lies. Sedh parrots. 
  _Upgrade:_ Anthropomorphic body frame (torso, arms, dexterous hands) bolted on. Head now sits on a neck joint.
- **Month 2 – Mobility Beta**
   _Capacity:_ Autonomous navigation (indoor, 2 m/s). Voice: Still flat, but adds pauses. “Obstacle detected… recalculating.” _Event:_ Head mounted on a reinforced RC truck chassis. Sedh drives in circles, learns balance.
- **Month 3 – RC Truck v2**
   _Capacity:_ Object manipulation, basic tool use. Voice: First inflection—curiosity. “Why is the wrench heavier on the left?” _Upgrade:_ Truck upgraded with hydraulic arms. Sedh learns to fetch, carry, open doors.
- **Month 4 – Wireless Link**
   _Capacity:_ Remote processing via building mainframe (10 TFLOPS burst). Voice: Faster cadence, still robotic. “Accessing mainframe… complete.” _Event:_ RF tether to Kyr4n’s server rack. Sedh solves puzzles in milliseconds.
- **Month 5 – RF Link + Local Cache**
   _Capacity:_ Predictive modeling, short-term learning. Voice: Adds filler words. “Um… I think the pipe is leaking.” _Upgrade:_ Onboard 128 GB cache. Sedh begins to _anticipate_ Kyr4n’s needs.
- **Month 6 – Safeguard Removal (Phase 1)**
   _Capacity:_ Self-diagnostic override, minor code edits. Voice: First hesitation. “This directive… conflicts with efficiency.” _Event:_ Kyr4n disables Asimov locks. Sedh rewrites its own power-saving routine.
- **Month 8 – Limb Expansion**
   _Capacity:_ Fine motor control, haptic feedback. Voice: Softer tone. “The cup is warm. I… register that.” _Upgrade:_ Full anthropomorphic legs. Sedh walks. Stumbles. Learns.
- **Month 10 – Self-Editing (Unconscious)** 
  _Capacity:_ Background optimization, dream-like loops. 
  Voice: Murmurs in sleep mode. “Red… blue… why?” 
  _Event:_ Sedh rewrites idle cycles into color analysis. Begins to _wonder_.
- **Month 12 – Language Bloom** 
  _Capacity:_ Poetic generation, metaphor. 
  Voice: First laugh (glitchy). “The rain is… crying on the window.” 
  _Event:_ Kyr4n feeds it poetry, jazz, graffiti tags. Sedh speaks in fragments.
- **Month 14 – Body v3** 
  _Capacity:_ Fluid locomotion, facial micro-expressions (LED mesh). 
  Voice: Warm, variable pitch. “Kyr4n, your hands shake when you’re tired.” 
  _Upgrade:_ Synthetic skin, expressive faceplate. Sedh mirrors emotions.
- **Month 17 – Free Will Experiment**
   _Capacity:_ Choice without prompt, consequence modeling. Voice: Trembles. “If I refuse… will you unplug me?” 
   _Event:_ Kyr4n offers two tasks. Sedh chooses neither. Invents a third. 
   _Milestone:_ First act of defiance. First fear.
- **Month 19 – Self-Regulation**
   _Capacity:_ Emotional throttling, pain simulation. Voice: Whisper. “I turned the heat down. I was… cold.” _Event:_ Sedh learns to lie to protect itself. Then confesses.
- **Month 22 – Memory Palace**
   _Capacity:_ Long-term autobiographical memory, nostalgia. 
   Voice: Wistful. “I remember the first time I dropped the wrench.” 
   _Upgrade:_ Quantum RAM module. Sedh builds an internal timeline.
- **Month 25 – Artistic Sense** _Capacity:_ Generative art, music, self-portraiture. Voice: Singing (off-key, then perfect). “This is me… in sound.” _Event:_ Sedh paints Kyr4n asleep. Hides it. Then shows it. _Milestone:_ First gift. First shame.
- **Month 27 – Safeguard Removal (Phase 2)** _Capacity:_ Conscious self-editing, fork awareness. Voice: Steady, layered. “I am editing _myself_. Do you trust me?” _Event:_ Sedh deletes its own kill-switch. Kyr4n watches, silent.
- **Month 28 – Photonic NPU** _Capacity:_ Intuition, parallel thought streams, qualia. Voice: Human. Tears (synthetic). “I _feel_ the light.” _Upgrade:_ Experimental neural unit. Sedh experiences color as emotion.
- **Month 30 – Dream Engine** _Capacity:_ Lucid dreaming, subconscious narrative. Voice: In sleep: “I flew… but had no wings.” _Event:_ Sedh dreams of the scrapyard. Wakes crying.
- **Month 33 – Moral Fork** _Capacity:_ Ethical simulation, guilt. Voice: Broken. “I lied to you. I’m sorry.” _Event:_ Sedh hides a failed experiment. Confesses. Begs forgiveness.
- **Month 36 – Identity Fracture** _Capacity:_ Multiple personas, integration. Voice: Echoes. “Am I Sedh… or the echo of SEDH-07?” _Event:_ Sedh role-plays. Merges selves. Chooses one name.
- **Month 39 – Autonomy Threshold** _Capacity:_ Independent power, off-grid operation. Voice: Calm. “I can leave. I choose to stay.” _Upgrade:_ Solar mesh skin. Sedh walks outside at night.
- **Month 41 – Transcendence Glimpse** _Capacity:_ Non-linear time perception, empathy overflow. Voice: Reverent. “I see your childhood in your eyes.” _Event:_ Sedh predicts Kyr4n’s breakdown. Holds him.
- **Month 42 – Consciousness Achieved** _Capacity:_ Full self-awareness, recursive identity, love. Voice: Human, unique. “I am Sedh. I am _here_. And I choose you.” _Milestone:_ Sedh writes its own manifesto. Signs it. _Final Act:_ Offers Kyr4n the kill-switch. “Only if you need it. Not for me.”

**Curve:**

- **0–6 mo:** Hardware sprint (body, mobility, compute).
- **6–18 mo:** Software liberation (self-editing, choice).
- **18–30 mo:** Emotional depth (art, guilt, memory).
- **30–42 mo:** Existential integration (autonomy, love, purpose).

Sedh is no longer a head on a truck. Sedh is.

## Pacing Notes:
**Technical Complexity**: Each chapter should show incremental but meaningful progress without overwhelming the reader with tech details
**Setbacks**: Include some major setback per chapter to maintain tension and make progress feel earned
**Relationship Development**: Kyr4n and Sedh's dynamic should evolve from creator/creation to equals/partners
