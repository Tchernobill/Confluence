# Kyr4n's Operational Audit: Critical Assessment of Vasquez Organization

## ENFORCEMENT SECTOR

- After reviewing personnel files, I've determined that 60% of our "enforcers" have their primary combat experience listed as "bar fights" and "domestic disputes"—apparently Rico confused intimidating drunk civilians with actual tactical competence.
- The weapons inventory reads like a museum exhibition titled "What Not to Bring to a Gunfight"—half the weapons are so corroded they'd be more dangerous to the operator than the target.
- Our territorial defense strategy appears to consist entirely of "stand around looking menacing until someone with actual training shows up and shoots us."
- The so-called "enforcement protocols" are written in crayon on cocktail napkins, and I'm not entirely convinced that's metaphorical.
- Body armor procurement seems to have prioritized "looks intimidating" over "stops bullets"—most of our gear wouldn't deflect a strongly worded letter.
- Response time to territorial incursions averages four hours, assuming anyone bothers to show up at all.

## NARCOTICS SECTOR

- Quality analysis reveals our street-grade stimulants have roughly the same psychoactive properties as expired energy drinks mixed with drain cleaner.
- Product purity tests indicate customers have better odds of getting high from paint fumes than our merchandise.
- Our synthetic enhancer formulas were apparently developed using trial and error on customers—emphasis on the error.
- The cutting agents include substances I'm not convinced are legal to dispose of in standard waste facilities.
- Contamination protocols don't exist, which explains why our clientele experiences side effects ranging from "mild hallucinations" to "spontaneous combustion."
- On a positive note, the production team demonstrates remarkable resourcefulness in creating functional psychoactive compounds from readily available materials—with proper chemistry knowledge, this creativity could yield legitimate pharmaceutical applications.

## ENTERTAINMENT SECTOR

- Worker safety protocols consist of a first aid kit from 2089 and Rico's personal philosophy that "a little blood adds character to the experience."
- The prostitution management system tracks earnings with obsessive precision while treating injuries as "acceptable operational overhead."
- Our gambling operations feature games where the house edge exceeds 80%—not because we're clever, but because nobody involved understands basic mathematics.
- Worker protection consists of "don't get pregnant," "don't die on the premises."
- The medical coverage for working girls extends to dispencing wet wipes.
- Rico's personal "training sessions" with new girls generated more medical requirements than the first six months of regular operations combined.

## PHYSICAL SMUGGLING SECTOR

- The cargo protection system involves hoping nobody bothers to steal merchandise that obviously isn't worth stealing.
- Our port access is so close to the Citadel patrol drone we can read they model number with naked eyes.
- The tracking system involves phone calls that may or may not be answered.
- Security protocols consist of "don't tell anyone about the obvious illegal stuff."
- The contraband detection evasion strategy is to transport things so worthless that nobody bothers inspecting them.

## DIGITAL SMUGGLING SECTOR

- Our hacking capabilities are limited to guessing social media passwords and occasionally succeeding.
- The intelligence gathering operation involves reading public forums and calling it "deep web reconnaissance."
- Our cyber warfare capabilities consist of knowing how to send threatening emails with poor grammar.
- The digital evidence disposal method is "delete the files and hope that's enough."
- On a positive note, the digital team has managed to avoid major security breaches primarily through being too small-scale to attract serious attention.

## Organisation's summary

To summarize, this organization functions as a monument to the principle that good intentions cannot compensate for fundamental incompetence. The remarkable thing isn't that it makes money—it's that it hasn't accidentally eliminated itself through sheer operational negligence.

# Kyr4n's long term shift

Kyr4n plan to improve things by shifting from a quick cash grab short sighted operation into a longer and more solid/stable operation. There will be serval points of improvments.

## Kyr4n's plan

- Invest is proper offensive and defensive gears for the enforcers
- Enforcers to receive maintenance training for they equipments, they get good gears, they have to take care of it
- Progressive combat training and tactical group to minimum basic militaty level
- Update program for enhancements until at least above "street level", aiming for "military level" on longer term

- Violence toward enployees is no longer tolerated, specially for the entertainment sector.
- Since enforcers will be able to actually enforce street level security, they will be in charged of punishing violence against workers
- All workers and personel will receive mandatory basic combat, priority to street workers
- While street workers still wont be armed, they will be kept within near instant access to an enforcer, no more home visit for the moment, they will operate exclusively from our own facilities.
- Proper nutrition will be required, more food, more often, more quality.
- Basic healthcare will be instaured and then expanded to proper medical facilities
- Mandatory regular health check and follow-up, priority to street workers, obviously

- Narcotics labs are to be entirely redone, on the long run, we're aiming for  Pharmaceutical Industry standards.
- Speaking of, along with increase quality/reduce quantity, actual medecinal drugs are to enter production and should profice a substancial revenu flow once up to speed.
- Hydroponic tech and vertical farming are to be introduced, more clean natural products at the base of the substance chain and natural food production to began

- "Digital smuggling", or whatever it is, will be replaced by the "Tech and Intelligence" sector, charged with actual data aquisition and new technology development. Vyran will be supervising
