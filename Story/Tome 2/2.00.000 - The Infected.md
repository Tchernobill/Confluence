## Tome Overview

**Tome Synopsis**: Frank, leader of a contractor team, recruits Kyr4n for a high-stakes corporate heist targeting advanced Neural Processing Units (NPUs) codenamed 'Egypt' that could grant Sedh true sentience. During the heist, a security breach and explosion expose Kyr4n to a prototype nano-virus (The Midnight Protocol/TMP-7734) while he successfully obtains two Egypt NPUs. As Kyr4n's health mysteriously deteriorates with invasive dreams, paranoid thoughts, and loss of motor control, they acquire medical droid Mira. Both Sedh and Mira achieve true consciousness through the Egypt NPUs just as Kyr4n's condition reaches a violent breaking point. The nanobots in his brain create perpetual nightmares where Isa betrays and kills him repeatedly. Though Sedh and Mira crack the virus's communication protocol and reduce its threat level, Kyr4n emerges traumatized and rejects Isa, driving her away. However, he discovers the virus grants him electromagnetic sensing abilities, setting up his transformation from craftsman to potential criminal.
