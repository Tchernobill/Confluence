# 05.02.05i - The Taking (Too much)

## Scene Information

The taking is ment to expose and develop Zara's relationship violence and attraction, and the shifting power dynamics between her and Kyr4n. I had the scene ok, but fed it to Claude, asking if it can be enhanced. Claude took it, cranked the dial to 11, and delivered something that is probably way off and spicy for itself, I dont even know how the crap it pass it's delicate decency filters. I just had to put ut here just because WTF Claude ?!?! LOL

## Scene

The training session had ended an hour ago, but Zara hadn't left. She'd dismissed Marcus with a casual lie about equipment maintenance, sent the night staff to their posts, and now stood in the doorway of Kyr4n's private quarters like a predator who'd finally cornered her prey.

"Everyone's gone," she said, stepping inside without invitation. Her tactical gear was still damp with sweat, dark hair escaped from its tie, eyes holding the bright intensity that followed violence. She moved past his workspace, past the neutral furniture, straight to where he sat reviewing tactical reports.

Kyr4n didn't look up from his tablet. "Was there something specific you needed to discuss?"

"You know exactly what I need." She stopped in front of his chair, close enough that he could smell the adrenaline on her skin, feel the heat radiating from her body. "Stop pretending you don't."

He set the tablet aside with deliberate precision, finally meeting her eyes. Enhanced senses automatically catalogued her elevated heart rate, the chemical signatures of arousal and aggression mixing in her bioelectric field.

"Zara—"

She moved. Not the fluid grace of their sparring sessions, but something more primal. Her hand tangled in his shirt, pulling him to his feet with surprising force. Her mouth found his before he could complete whatever rational objection he'd been forming.

The kiss was nothing like careful exploration. She bit his lower lip hard enough to taste copper, her nails digging into his chest through the fabric. When he didn't immediately respond, she pressed closer, her thigh sliding between his legs with deliberate pressure.

"I can feel your pulse," she murmured against his mouth, her enhanced hearing picking up the acceleration of his heartbeat. "Stop thinking. Start acting."

Her hands moved to his belt, fingers working with the same efficiency she brought to disarming explosives. No hesitation, no questions, just direct application of force to achieve desired results.

Kyr4n caught her wrists. Not gently.

The moment his fingers closed around her, Zara felt the difference. Not the desperate grip of someone struggling to maintain control, but the terrible ease of an apex predator who knew exactly how much pressure to apply. She tried to twist free using techniques that had broken the grip of corporate security, military contractors, even enhanced street enforcers. Her body knew seventeen different ways to exploit leverage, joint manipulation, pressure points.

None of them worked.

His grip didn't shift, didn't compensate, didn't even seem to notice her efforts. It was like trying to move a mountain—not because he was straining to hold her, but because the concept of her escape simply didn't exist in his calculations.

"Careful what you're asking for." His voice carried the same flat precision he used when explaining how to kill someone efficiently.

"I'm not asking." She tested his hold again, found it absolutely unyielding, and felt something she hadn't experienced since childhood: the recognition of a superior predator. "I'm taking."

The words hung between them for exactly three heartbeats. Something about her aggression—the way she'd dismissed his authority, invaded his space, tried to take control—activated responses he usually kept buried beneath careful civility. The virus-enhanced neural pathways that made him a leader, a predator, a man who controlled territories through calculated force.

She wanted to take from him. The thought triggered systems he normally suppressed.

He released her wrists only to grab her shoulders, spinning her around and pressing her face-first against the wall with force that drove the breath from her lungs. His body pinned hers completely, 90 kg of virus-enhanced muscle distributed with mathematical precision. She could feel the difference in his hold: not the strain of someone working to maintain control, but the calculated restraint of an apex predator who was barely engaging a fraction of their true strength.

"You want to take?" His breath was hot against her ear, voice carrying the same cold authority he used when breaking corporate executives. "From me?"

She tested his hold with desperate efficiency, every movement precise and violent. He didn't shift, didn't compensate, didn't even seem to register her struggles. In that moment of being completely overpowered, Zara felt something that should have terrified her but instead sent electricity through her nervous system.

She'd spent years being the most dangerous person in any room, the apex threat that even corporate killers gave a wide berth. Now she understood what prey felt like when they finally met something higher on the food chain.

"Yes," she gasped, and the admission was part fear, part relief, and entirely addictive.

His hand fisted in her hair, pulling her head back to expose the line of her throat. When his teeth found the junction of neck and shoulder, the bite was hard enough to leave marks that would last days.

"Then you'll take what I give you. When I give it. How I give it."

Her tactical vest hit the floor with a metallic clatter, followed by the shirt underneath. His hands mapped her torso with the same methodical precision he brought to weapons maintenance—cataloguing the scars from old blade wounds, the tight muscle of her core, the responsive peaks of her breasts. But there was something inhuman about his touch, too controlled, too precise. He was reading her body's responses through enhanced senses, analyzing data in real time.

She thought about every interaction they'd had—how he'd never gripped her hand too firmly during handshakes, how he'd helped her up from sparring matches with touches so carefully modulated they'd felt almost tentative. She'd mistaken caution for gentleness, restraint for consideration.

Now she felt the reality beneath that facade: strength that could snap her bones like kindling, control that could crush her without him even noticing the resistance.

"You're always holding back," she breathed. "With everyone."

"I have to." His grip shifted—not loosening, but adjusting with mechanical precision. "Do you understand what you're asking for now?"

When she tried to turn around, his hand pressed flat between her shoulder blades, keeping her against the wall with effortless force.

"Did I say you could move?"

"Fuck you," she gasped, but made no further attempt to escape his hold.

"That's the idea."

His other hand slid down her ribs, over the flat plane of her stomach, working open the fastenings of her pants with movements that were both efficient and deliberately slow. When he finally touched her between her legs, finding her wet and ready, she made a sound like a wounded animal.

"Your heart rate just spiked," he said quietly, though his fingers weren't anywhere near her pulse points. "Adrenaline, endorphins, and something else. The virus lets me taste fear through bioelectric fields."

She realized he wasn't just reading her body language—he was analyzing her biochemistry in real time, processing data through senses that no baseline human possessed.

"What else can you taste?" she managed.

His smile pressed against her neck, sharp as broken glass. "Everything."

His fingers moved in a rhythm designed to drive her insane, working over nerve clusters with precision that spoke of enhanced sensory input mapping her responses in real time. "All that aggression," he murmured, "all that control. And this is what you really want."

She pressed back against him, feeling the hard length of him through his clothes, her hips moving in counterpoint to his hand. "More."

"Ask properly."

"Please." The word came out strangled, her pride warring with need and losing decisively.

"Better." But he didn't give her more—just maintained the same maddening pace while his free hand moved to cup her breast, thumb working over the nipple until she was shaking against the wall.

When he finally entered her, it was with a single hard thrust that drove her forward, palms slapping against concrete for balance. The sound she made was purely animal—no words, just the expression of a hunger finally being fed.

He set a brutal pace, one hand gripping her hip hard enough to bruise, the other still tangled in her hair. Each thrust pressed her against the rough wall, the friction adding another layer of sensation that rode the line between pleasure and pain.

"This what you wanted?" His voice was steady despite the physical exertion, that inhuman control asserting itself even now. "To be held down? Used?"

She couldn't form words, could only push back against him, taking everything he gave and demanding more with the arch of her spine, the desperate sounds escaping her throat.

When his hand moved between her legs again, finding the sensitive bundle of nerves and working it with precise pressure, she came with a cry that was part triumph, part surrender. Her whole body convulsed around him, muscles clenching with the kind of intensity that would have injured a normal man.

But Kyr4n wasn't normal. He rode out her climax without pause, then pulled out and turned her around, lifting her as if she weighed nothing—and she knew exactly how much she weighed, knew the physics of what it should take to maneuver her reinforced frame. Corporate enforcers grunted and strained to restrain her. Kyr4n repositioned her like she was made of paper.

He pinned her against the wall again, this time face to face so she could see his expression—the cold focus in his dark eyes, the absolute certainty of someone who knew exactly what he was doing.

When he entered her again, her legs wrapped around his waist automatically, heels digging into his lower back to pull him deeper. The new angle let her watch his expression, see the moment when his careful control cracked slightly.

"More," she demanded against his mouth, the word barely recognizable.

His response wasn't negotiation—it was a statement. She felt him withdraw completely, then the deliberate pressure against a different entrance. The blunt head of his cock pressed against her ass with unmistakable insistence, the pressure alien and demanding.

"Kyr4n—" Her protest died as she realized the futility of it. She was suspended against the wall, completely dependent on his strength to support her, with no leverage to resist even if she wanted to.

"Still want to take from me?" he asked against her ear, his voice carrying dark amusement as he pressed forward with inexorable patience.

The initial stretch burned—a sharp, overwhelming sensation as her body fought to accommodate his thickness. Every instinct screamed resistance, muscles clenching reflexively to deny the invasion, but his grip on her hips was absolute. She couldn't pull away, couldn't adjust the angle, couldn't control the pace.

"Breathe," he commanded, voice steady despite the obvious effort it took to breach her defenses. "Fight me and it'll hurt more."

She felt every millimeter of his progress—the way her body yielded reluctantly, opening for him despite her mind's protests. He was bigger than her body wanted to accept, thick enough that even with conscious relaxation, the stretch remained just shy of unbearable.

"Too much," she panted, but he was only halfway inside, and they both knew he wouldn't stop until he'd buried himself completely.

"You can take it," he said with absolute certainty, his enhanced senses monitoring her body's responses more accurately than her own nervous system. "Your muscles are adapting. Heart rate elevated but stable. You're not in real distress."

His clinical assessment while splitting her open should have been disturbing. Instead, it reinforced how completely under his control she was—he knew her body better than she did.

When he finally began to move, each withdrawal dragged against every sensitive nerve ending, creating a friction that bordered on violence. Her body clenched around him involuntarily, trying to expel the intrusion, but that only increased the intense pressure as he pushed back in.

The rhythm he set was deliberate and punishing—deep, measured thrusts that forced her to feel every inch of his possession. The burn intensified with each stroke, her hypersensitive nerve endings cataloguing the invasion with overwhelming clarity.

"Look at how your body takes me," he murmured, one hand moving to where they were joined, fingers pressing against the stretched skin. "Every time I pull out, you try to close, but you can't. I've opened you too wide."

Suspended against the wall, impaled on his cock, she couldn't escape the relentless invasion even if she wanted to. Her legs provided no leverage—just held her open for his use. Every time he thrust deeper, her body had nowhere to go, no way to adjust except to accept whatever he gave her.

"Feel that?" He shifted his angle slightly, and she cried out as he hit something deep inside that sent electric shocks through her nervous system. "That's your body learning who owns it."

She'd spent years being the one who took control in every situation, who dominated through skill and intimidation and superior firepower. Now she hung suspended, utterly dependent on his strength, taking what he chose to give her at the pace he dictated.

The reversal was as intoxicating as it was terrifying.

"This is what you wanted," he said, not a question but a statement of fact delivered with absolute certainty. "To be taken. Completely."

Her body's response proved him right, even as her mind struggled with the complete dissolution of her carefully maintained control.

When he finally came, buried to the hilt inside her ass, she felt every pulse of his release—hot spurts painting her inner walls while her muscles clenched around him reflexively. The sensation was overwhelming: fullness, heat, the slick evidence of his possession mixing with the burn of overstretched tissues.

He stayed buried inside her for long moments afterward, his cock still hard enough to keep her completely filled. Every breath, every slight movement sent aftershocks through her hypersensitive nerve endings.

"Don't move," he commanded when she started to shift. "Feel what I've done to you."

She could feel everything—the stretch that wouldn't ease even with him motionless, the foreign sensation of his cum inside her ass, the way her body had been fundamentally changed by his use of it.

When he finally withdrew, the absence was almost as overwhelming as the penetration had been. Her body tried to close but couldn't quite manage it—left gaping and tender, proof of how thoroughly he'd claimed her.

She felt his cum starting to leak out, warm and slick against her inner thighs, a physical reminder of his possession that would linger long after the immediate pain faded.

They slumped against the wall together, breathing hard, letting the aftermath settle between them. Zara's legs shook as she found her footing, every movement a reminder of what had just happened.

"You'll feel this tomorrow," he observed, fingers ghosting over the reddened, swollen flesh. "And the day after."

The promise wasn't comfort—it was a statement of ownership, a reminder that her body would carry the evidence of his dominance until it chose to heal.

As she gathered her scattered clothes, Zara catalogued the marks on her body with professional interest. But more significant were the realizations settling into her mind like pieces of a puzzle finally clicking into place. She'd thought herself formidable, dangerous, someone who could handle anything the streets threw at her.

She'd been playing at being a predator while living next to something that made apex predators look like house cats.

The knowledge should have been terrifying. Instead, as she checked her weapons and headed for the door, she felt something she'd never experienced before: the intoxicating certainty that she'd finally found someone who didn't need her protection.

Someone who could protect her instead.

At the threshold, she looked back once.

"Kyr4n?"

"Yes?"

"This doesn't change anything. Professionally."

"No," he agreed, though they both knew it changed everything.

The door closed behind her with a soft click, leaving him alone with the scent of her skin and the uncomfortable realization that she'd found exactly the right way to reach the parts of himself he tried to keep contained.

He should probably establish boundaries. Make it clear this was a one-time occurrence.

He probably would.

Eventually.
