## Scene

The training session had ended an hour ago, but Zara hadn't left. She'd dismissed Marcus with a casual lie about equipment maintenance, sent the night staff to their posts, and now stood in the doorway of Vyr4n's private quarters like a predator who'd finally cornered her prey.

"Everyone's gone," she said, stepping inside without invitation. Her tactical gear was still damp with sweat, dark hair escaped from its tie, eyes holding the bright intensity that followed violence. She moved past his workspace, past the neutral furniture, straight to where he sat reviewing reports.

Vyr4n didn't look up from his tablet. "Was there something specific you needed to discuss?"

"You know exactly what I need." She stopped in front of his chair, close enough that he could smell the adrenaline on her skin, feel the heat radiating from her body. "Stop pretending you don't."

He set the tablet aside with deliberate precision, finally meeting her eyes.

"I'm not sure—"

She moved. Not the fluid grace of their sparring sessions, but something more primal. Her hand tangled in his shirt, pulling him to his feet with surprising force. Her mouth found his before he could complete whatever rational objection he'd been forming.

The kiss was nothing like careful exploration. She bit his lower lip hard enough to taste copper, her nails digging into his chest through the fabric. When he didn't immediately respond, she pressed closer with deliberate pressure.

"I can feel your pulse," she murmured against his mouth, her enhanced hearing picking up the acceleration of his heartbeat. "Stop thinking. Start acting."

Her hands moved to his belt, fingers working with the same efficiency she brought to disarming explosives. No hesitation, no questions, just direct application of force to achieve desired results.

Vyr4n caught her wrists. Not gently.

"What are you asking for—" His voice carried a growing darker tone.

"I'm not asking." She twisted against his grip, testing his strength, finding it exactly as overwhelming as she'd hoped. "I'm taking."

The words hung between them for exactly three heartbeats. Something about her aggression—the way she'd dismissed his authority, invaded his space, tried to take control—touched a part of him that had spent years learning to dominate through necessity. The virus-enhanced neural pathways that made him a leader, a predator, a man who controlled territories through calculated force.

She wanted to take from him. The thought activated responses he usually kept buried beneath careful civility.

He released her wrists only to grab her shoulders, spinning her around and pressing her face-first against the wall hard enough that her cheek scraped concrete. His body pinned hers completely, 90 kg of activating muscle holding her immobile with casual ease.

"You want to take?" His breath was hot against her ear, voice carrying the same cold authority he used when talking to oppositions. "From me?"

She tested his hold, found it absolutely unyielding, and made a sound that was half growl, half moan. "Yes."

His hand fisted in her hair, pulling her head back to expose the line of her throat. When his teeth found the junction of neck and shoulder, the bite was hard enough to leave marks, she tasted raw and salty.

"Then you'll take what I give you. When I give it. How I give it."

Her tactical vest hit the floor with a metallic clatter, followed by the shirt underneath. His hands started to explore her her torso like a cartographer—cataloguing the scars from old blade wounds, the tight muscle of her core, the responsive peaks of her breasts.

When she tried to turn around, his hand pressed flat between her shoulder blades, keeping her against the wall.

"Did I say you could move?"

"Fuck you," she gasped, but made no further attempt to escape his hold.

"That's the idea."

His other hand slid down her ribs, over the flat plane of her stomach, working open the fastenings of her pants with movements that were both efficient and deliberately slow. When he finally touched her between her legs, finding her wet and ready, she made a sound like a wounded animal.

"All that aggression," he murmured, his fingers moving in a rhythm designed to drive her insane. "All that control. And this is what you really want."

She pressed back against him, feeling the hard length of him through his clothes, her hips moving in counterpoint to his hand. "More."

"Ask properly."

"Please." The word came out strangled, her pride warring with need and losing decisively.

"Better." But he didn't give her more—just maintained the same maddening pace while his free hand moved to cup her breast, thumb working over the nipple until she was shaking against the wall.

When he finally entered her, it was with a single hard thrust that drove her forward, palms slapping against concrete for balance. The sound she made was purely animal—no words, just the expression of a hunger finally being fed.

He set a brutal pace, one hand gripping her hip hard enough to bruise, the other still tangled in her hair. Each thrust pressed her against the rough wall, the friction adding another layer of sensation that rode the line between pleasure and pain.

"This what you wanted?" His voice was steady despite the physical exertion, that inhuman control asserting itself even now. "To be held down? Used?"

She couldn't form words, could only push back against him, taking everything he gave and demanding more with the arch of her spine, the desperate sounds escaping her throat.

When his hand moved between her legs again, finding the sensitive bundle of nerves and working it with precise pressure, she came with a cry that was part triumph, part surrender. Her whole body convulsed around him, muscles clenching with the kind of intensity that would have injured a normal man.

But Vyr4n wasn't normal. He rode out her climax without pause, then pulled out and turned her around, lifting her as if she weighed nothing and pinning her back against the wall. This time she could see his face—the cold focus in his dark eyes, the absolute certainty of someone who knew exactly what he was doing.

When he entered her again, her legs wrapped around his waist automatically, heels digging into his lower back to pull him deeper. The new angle let her watch his expression, see the moment when his careful control finally cracked.

"More," she demanded against his mouth, the word barely recognizable.

His response was to shift his grip, one hand supporting her weight while the other moved between them. She felt him withdraw completely, then the blunt pressure against a different entrance—one that made her eyes widen with sudden understanding.

"Vyr4n—" Her protest died as he pressed forward slowly, inexorably, watching her face with predatory focus.

The initial stretch made her breath hitch, fingers digging into his shoulders as her body adjusted to the unfamiliar invasion. For a moment her usual confidence flickered, replaced by something more vulnerable.

"Too much?" His voice was rough but controlled, ready to stop despite the tension in every muscle.

She bit her lip, breathing hard as the discomfort shifted into something else entirely. "No," she managed, then with growing certainty: "No. Don't stop."

When he began to move, her head fell back against the wall, a low sound escaping her throat that was pure surprised pleasure. This was intensity beyond what she'd expected, a complete surrender of control that made every nerve ending sing.

He set a rhythm that was deliberately slow at first, letting her body adjust to the unfamiliar sensation. Her breathing became ragged, punctuated by soft gasps each time he filled her completely. The careful control he maintained—reading every micro-expression, every tension in her muscles—only amplified the intensity.

"Harder," she finally managed, her voice barely recognizable.

His pace increased, each thrust driving her higher against the wall, and she felt herself building toward something that seemed impossibly intense. When her climax hit, it was different—deeper, more consuming than before—and she cried out with genuine surprise at the overwhelming sensation.

The sound of her release, the way her body clenched around him, finally broke his iron control.

His climax was silent except for the sharp intake of breath and a grunt, his body going rigid as he spent himself inside her.

For a moment they stayed frozen like that—her back against the wall, his arms supporting her weight, both breathing hard in the sudden quiet.

When he finally lowered her to the floor, her legs were unsteady. Dark marks were already forming on her wrists where he'd gripped her, matching bruises on her hips. His eyes tracked the damage with automatic assessment, and something shifted in his expression.

"I'm—"

Her hand slapped over his mouth before he could finish the apology, her palm warm against his lips.

"Shhh." Her eyes held a warning that was half-amused, half-serious. "Don't ruin this for me."

He raised an eyebrow over her hand.

"I asked for this. I wanted this. These—" She gestured at the darkening marks with her free hand, "—are exactly what I needed." Her thumb brushed across his lower lip as she pulled her hand away. "Start apologizing and I'll have to hurt you properly."

The threat was delivered with the same matter-of-fact tone she used to discuss weapons maintenance, but there was genuine warning beneath it.

"Understood," he said quietly.

"Good." She touched one of the bruises on her wrist experimentally, pressing into the tender flesh with something like satisfaction. "You'll feel that tomorrow," he observed, already reaching for his discarded clothes.

"Good."

As she gathered her scattered clothes, Vyr4n returned to his chair and picked up the tactical reports, but the words blurred on the screen. The careful boundaries he maintained within himself, between protection and control—had just shifted in ways he wasn't sure he understood.

She dressed efficiently and headed for the door. At the threshold, she looked back once.

"Vyr4n?"

"Yes?"

"This doesn't change anything. Professionally."

"No," he agreed, though they both knew it changed everything.

The door closed behind her with a soft click, leaving him alone with the scent of her skin and the uncomfortable realization that she'd found exactly the right way to reach the parts of himself he tried to keep contained.

He should probably establish boundaries. Make it clear this was a one-time occurrence.

He probably would.

Eventually.
