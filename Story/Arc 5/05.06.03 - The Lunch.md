## The Events

- Lunch with multiple members of Kyr4n's inner circle
- Isa is reminiscent of the early days she met Kyr4n
- She mention the close call with the Enforcer at the market
- Kyr4n laugh and mention that Robert (the enforcer) is now a security patrol in the northen sector
- Isa is shocked that someone that tried to kill Kyr4n is working for his organisation
- Kyr4n explain that someday, that enforcer showed up, they talked, patched things up while Kyr4n was fixing his armor leg
- Kyr4n then mention that there is about 15 individuals that tried that kill him currently working in the organisation, 5 of them are even at this table
- Isa tell Kyr4n that he is insane, and that he could probably make it 6 now
- When everyone is puzzled, Isa explain that one of the lesser faction of the Citadel hired her to assassinate Kyr4n
- While everyone was shocked by the bomb revelation, Kyr4n took another bite of his sandwich
- Marcus face freeze, some feel awkward, Zara started to silently move closer behind Isa, hand on her weapon
- Dr Helene asked Isa if she was joking to which Isa casually confirmed it's true
- Kyr4n, swallowing his bite, amused, ask her how would she do it?
- Isa reply that she would first try to get re-introduced in his life, maybe through a contact, she'd get closer to him until he is comfortable with her presence, then she'd start making him bad coffee (describing exactly how she came back in his life)
- Kyr4n burst in laughter, most of those at the table had never heard him laugh, he declare that her plan could actually work! Only, she's have to manage to get her coffee worst than Ol'Tom's Brewed stuff from the Marker
- Isa admit that would be a serious challenge as Tom's brewery had more in common with used motor oil than anything drinkable
- Helene do press Isa for more details.
- Isa explain that Nordem, the Citadel leading faction, is planning something drastic to get rid of Kyr4n and bring back the Slum to it's low position, something like mass purge or something, but it so scary than most Citadel lower factions are desperate for an emergency plan that would fix the problem before Nordem act
- Isa mention the rumor that Nordem is aquiring a medium yield nuke and it could be linked
- Kyr4n then say that maybe they need to put Operation Snowfall in higher gear, giving Helene goosebumps

## The Scene

The executive cafeteria had been one of Kyr4n's more controversial improvements to the organization's headquarters. Where Rico's regime had maintained a strict hierarchy of who ate what and where, the new system operated on a simple principle: good food, shared space, and conversations that happened naturally rather than through formal briefings.

Isa sat at one of the round tables, a steaming bowl of actual soup—not protein paste—in front of her, watching the easy interactions between people who clearly functioned as more than just colleagues. Dr. Helene moved between tables with maternal efficiency, checking that everyone was eating properly. Marcus consulted quietly with his security staff while managing to include Jin in the tactical discussion. Kaia held court at a corner table, dispensing information with the elegance of someone serving fine wine.

"This is surreal," Isa said, taking another spoonful of what tasted like real vegetables. "Remember when luxury meant finding a nutrition bar that didn't taste like recycled cardboard?"

Kyr4n settled across from her with his own lunch—a sandwich that looked disappointingly normal for someone who commanded this level of operation. "The food budget was one of my first priorities," he said. "Turns out people work better when they're not constantly hungry. Revolutionary concept."

"Revolutionary for a criminal organization," Zara added, sliding into the seat beside him with predatory grace. "Most bosses think fear and deprivation build character."

"Most bosses are idiots," Marcus said, joining them with a plate that could have fed three people. His cybernetic arm moved with fluid precision as he managed his utensils. "Though I still say the coffee budget is excessive."

"You can't put a price on proper stimulants," Dr. Helene said, appearing at their table with her own meal. "Proper nutrition supports cognitive function, which supports better decision-making, which supports organizational efficiency." She settled into her chair with the satisfied air of someone whose maternal instincts had found productive outlet. "Basic medical logic."

Isa grinned, the expression transforming her angular features. "Listen to yourselves. You sound like a functional family arguing about household expenses."

"We are a functional family," Sedh said, approaching with Maya in tow. The AI moved with increasing human-like fluidity, while Maya looked like she'd rather be buried in code than socializing. "Just one with more weapons and fewer blood relations."

"Speaking of the early days," Isa said, stirring her soup thoughtfully, "I was remembering that enforcer who tried to shake you down at the market. That massive guy with the chrome arm who thought intimidation was a valid business strategy."

Kyr4n paused mid-bite, a small smile playing at the corners of his mouth. "Robert. Corporate Enforcement Division, specializing in protection racket operations."

"Right, him." Isa's eyes sparkled with mischief. "The one who tried to crush your skull and instead got a screwdriver in his leg servo. Whatever happened to—"

"He's running security patrol in the Northern Sector," Kyr4n said casually, then took another bite of his sandwich.

Isa's spoon stopped halfway to her mouth. "I'm sorry, what?"

"Robert Martinez. He showed up about eighteen months ago, looking for work. We had a conversation, patched things up while I fixed his armor leg properly—corporate tech support had done a terrible job with the repair." Kyr4n's tone remained conversational, as if discussing weather patterns. "He's actually quite competent when he's not being incentivized to terrorize small business owners."

"The guy who tried to kill you is now working for you?" Isa's voice carried the particular incredulity reserved for statements that challenged basic concepts of reality.

"There are approximately fifteen individuals currently in this organization who have, at some point, attempted to end my life," Kyr4n replied with academic precision. "Five of them are sitting at this table."

The casual revelation created a moment of profound silence. Isa looked around the table, studying faces with new understanding.

"You're insane," she said finally. "Completely, certifiably insane." She paused, considering. "Though I suppose that could make it sixteen now."

Puzzled looks passed between the assembled group. Marcus's cybernetic hand paused halfway to his mouth, while Zara's dark eyes narrowed with sudden focus.

"Sixteen?" Dr. Helene asked, her medical instincts clearly detecting something significant in Isa's tone.

"Well," Isa said with the casual air of someone discussing lunch plans, "one of the lesser Citadel factions did hire me to assassinate him."

The revelation hit the table like a carefully placed electromagnetic pulse. Marcus's face went completely still, his military training warring with social protocols. Dr. Helene's eyes widened behind her wire-rimmed glasses. Kaia leaned forward with the focused attention of someone whose profession involved parsing dangerous information. Zara's hand moved with subtle precision toward the concealed weapon at her hip, positioning herself behind Isa's chair with predatory silence.

Maya looked up from her tablet for the first time since sitting down, while Sedh's optical sensors brightened with what might have been fascination or concern.

Kyr4n, meanwhile, took another measured bite of his sandwich.

"Are you joking?" Dr. Helene asked, her voice carrying the careful neutrality of someone hoping for a specific answer.

"Not even a little bit," Isa confirmed cheerfully. "Standard contract, decent pay, very specific target parameters. They were quite thorough in their briefing materials."

The silence stretched until Kyr4n finished chewing and swallowed with deliberate care. When he spoke, his voice carried genuine amusement.

"How would you do it?"

The question broke through the tension like a scalpel through tissue. Isa's eyes lit up with professional appreciation.

"Well, first I'd need to get reintroduced into your life. Maybe through a mutual contact—someone you trust who could vouch for me." She gestured toward Sedh with her spoon. "Then I'd work on rebuilding familiarity, making you comfortable with my presence again. Regular interactions, shared memories, gradual integration into your daily routine."

Zara's hand remained on her weapon, but her posture suggested analytical interest rather than immediate threat assessment.

"Once I had access and you were relaxed around me, I'd start making you terrible coffee," Isa continued with the matter-of-fact tone of someone explaining technical specifications. "Gradually poisoning you with substances disguised as caffeinated beverages until your enhanced metabolism finally succumbed to cumulative toxicity."

The description of her actual return to his life—delivered as an assassination methodology—sent Kyr4n into genuine laughter. The sound was rich, unguarded, and apparently so rare that several conversations at other tables paused to locate its source.

"That could actually work!" he managed between chuckles. "Though you'd have to manage coffee worse than Ol'Tom's Brewed Death from the underground market. That's a serious technical challenge."

"Tom's brewery has more in common with used motor oil than anything intended for human consumption," Isa agreed solemnly. "I'm not sure even I could achieve that level of toxic incompetence."

"Focus, please," Dr. Helene interrupted with maternal authority. "Isa, we need more details about this contract. Who approached you? What were their specific objectives?"

The humor faded from Isa's expression as she recognized the gravity beneath the casual conversation. "Nordem Industries. They're the leading faction in the Citadel's current power structure, and they're planning something drastic to restore the slums to their previous state of exploitable desperation."

"Define 'drastic,'" Marcus said, his military experience automatically cataloguing threat levels.

"Mass purge operations. Systematic elimination of community leaders, infrastructure destruction, probably some kind of demonstration that would make people too terrified to resist corporate control again." Isa's voice carried the flat precision of someone reporting technical specifications. "It's so extreme that even the lesser factions are desperate for alternatives. Hence the assassination contract—remove the source of organized resistance before Nordem implements their final solution."

"How final are we talking?" Kaia asked, her intelligence networks clearly processing implications.

"There are rumors about nuclear acquisition," Isa said quietly. "Medium yield device, probably intended for psychological impact rather than strategic destruction. Make it look like slum-based terrorism while eliminating organized opposition in a single strike."

The table went silent again, but this time the quality was different—focused, analytical, the quiet of people processing threat data and calculating response options.

Kyr4n set down his sandwich with deliberate precision. "Maya, I need you to accelerate the timetable for Operation Nightfall. Move everything to Priority Alpha status."

"How much acceleration?" Maya asked, her fingers already moving across her tablet interface.

"Assume we have weeks instead of months." He looked around the table, meeting each person's eyes in turn. "Whatever Nordem is planning, we're going to make sure they never get the chance to implement it."

"And Isa's contract?" Zara asked, her hand still resting casually near her weapon.

"Expired the moment she told us about it," Kyr4n said simply. "Though I reserve the right to complain if she actually does start making terrible coffee."

"Noted," Isa said with mock solemnity. "I'll stick to my actual area of expertise."

"Which is?" Dr. Helene asked.

"Making things work better than they're supposed to," Isa replied, her smile carrying the same confidence that had once made her successful in the underground markets. "Just like old times."

As conversations resumed around the table, the easy familiarity gradually returned, but with new undertones of urgency. They were still a functional family sharing a meal, but now they were also a military unit preparing for war.

The only question was whether they could move fast enough to prevent Nordem from turning their chosen battlefield into radioactive wasteland.
