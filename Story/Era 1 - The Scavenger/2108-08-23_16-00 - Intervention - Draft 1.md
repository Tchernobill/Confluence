# Scene Draft: Intervention

**Setting:** Temporary public workshop area, South Shore Slum  
**Time:** afternoon (Saturday, following Riley and Isa's planning meeting)  
**Characters:** Kyr4n (24), Isa (24), Riley (24)  
**Tone:** Concern, gentle intervention, resistance, vulnerability  
**Context:** Few weeks after riot, underground market destroyed, temporary vendor spaces established

---

The temporary workshop area occupied what had been a loading dock before the riots—open-sided, exposed to the street, with makeshift tables built from salvaged doors and cinder blocks. Nothing like the discrete alcove in the underground market. No shadows to disappear into, no quick escape routes through tunnels. Just concrete and exposure and the constant awareness of being visible.

Kyr4n hated it.

But it was work. And work meant credits meant survival, so here he was with his portable workstation spread across a repurposed door, repairing a comm unit for one of the few customers brave enough to approach his makeshift stall. His tools felt wrong in his hands today—fingers not quite steady, focus slipping despite his best efforts.

He'd been underground for three days straight after returning Isa to her place. Three days in his hideout trying to recalibrate, to remember how to exist without her warmth beside him in the confined space. Three days that should have restored his equilibrium but had somehow made everything worse.

The comm unit's circuit board blurred slightly. He blinked, refocused.

"Kyry."

Isa's voice. He looked up to find both her and Riley approaching his stall, and something in his chest did a complicated twist. They'd clearly coordinated—arrived together, united front. Riley carried two cups of something that smelled like actual tea.

"Hey," Kyr4n managed. His hands stilled on the circuit board. "Didn't know you were... both of you."

"Finished that delivery early," Riley said easily, setting one cup near Kyr4n's elbow. "Thought we'd stop by."

Isa leaned against the table, close enough that her shoulder brushed his. The contact made him acutely aware of how much he'd missed physical proximity these past three days, and how dangerous that want was.

"How's business?" she asked.

"Slow." He gestured at the nearly empty workspace. "People are still scattered after the riot. Haven't found new regular spots yet."

"Makes sense." Riley pulled up a salvaged crate to sit on, somehow making the awkward perch look comfortable. "Everything's still settling."

They made small talk for a few minutes—careful, circling something. Kyr4n could feel the purpose behind this visit like static electricity before a storm. Finally, Isa's hand covered his where it rested on the circuit board.

"We need to talk about your living situation," she said directly.

There it was.

Kyr4n's jaw tightened. "It's fine."

"It's not fine." Isa's voice was gentle but firm. "Kyry, that hideout isn't viable. It never was, but especially not now. You need actual space. Actual living conditions."

"It's secure." He pulled his hand away, returning to the circuit board with too much focus. "I know every approach, every escape route. I can control—"

"You can't control everything," Riley interrupted quietly. "And you shouldn't have to live like that. Forty meters underground in a concrete box?"

"You've seen it?" Kyr4n looked up sharply.

"Isa told me." Riley's expression was understanding, not judgmental. "Two meters by four meters. No windows. Barely any ventilation."

"It's what I need." The words came out defensive. "For security. For—"

"For isolation," Isa finished. "I get it. I do. But Kyry..." She moved around the table so he had to look at her. "Is that really what you need? Or is it just what you're used to?"

He didn't have an answer for that.

"My place has actual space," Isa continued. "Actual furniture. You could set up a proper workshop instead of working on a folding table. Real bed instead of—whatever you call that nest of fabric you sleep on."

"I can't just move in with you." The idea was simultaneously appealing and terrifying. "That's... we barely... it's too fast."

"Is it?" Isa's hand found his again. "We spent two days living in two square meters together. I think we've already done the hard part."

"That was crisis circumstances. Temporary." He was grasping at arguments, and they both knew it. "This would be..."

"Permanent?" Riley supplied gently. "Or at least more permanent than either of you are comfortable admitting to?"

Kyr4n shot him a look. Riley just smiled that patient smile, the one that made Kyr4n feel simultaneously seen and safe.

"Look," Isa said, "I'm not asking you to make some huge commitment or give up your independence. I'm asking you to stop living in conditions that would break most people." Her voice softened. "You deserve better than that concrete hole."

"I don't—" Kyr4n stopped, the automatic denial dying in his throat.

"You don't what?" Riley asked. "Deserve it? Because I'm going to have to strongly disagree with that assessment."

"It's not about deserving." Kyr4n's hands were shaking slightly now. He shoved them under the table. "It's about... what if things go wrong? What if I need to disappear? What if—"

"What if you could have actual support instead of living in constant crisis mode?" Isa countered. "What if you didn't have to do everything alone?"

"I've been alone for two years. I'm used to it."

"Being used to something doesn't make it good." Riley's voice was quiet but certain. "And you're not as alone as you think. Not anymore."

Kyr4n looked between them—Isa with her direct gaze and determined set to her jaw, Riley with his gentle persistence and understanding eyes. Both of them here, together, because they cared. Because they wanted better for him than he wanted for himself.

"I don't know how to do this," he admitted quietly. "Living with someone. Sharing space. Trusting that it won't..."

"Won't what?" Isa prompted.

"Fall apart." The words barely made it out. "Everything falls apart eventually."

"Not everything," Riley said. "And even if it does—which it won't—you'll still be okay. You'll still have options. You'll still have people who care about you."

"Both of us," Isa added. "This isn't just me making an offer. Riley's part of this too."

Kyr4n's eyes snapped to Riley. "What?"

Riley's expression was open, honest. "I care about you. Both of you. And if Isa's offering you a better place to live, I'm absolutely supporting that. Whatever form that takes."

The implications hung in the air between them. Kyr4n processed slowly—the three of them, not just him and Isa. Riley included, wanted, part of whatever they were building.

"I can't... I don't know if I can be what you both want." His voice cracked slightly. "I'm not good at this. At people. At relationships."

"You're doing better than you think," Isa said softly. "And we're not asking for perfect. We're just asking you to try. To let us help."

"The hideout..." Kyr4n grasped at the last objection. "I can't just abandon it. All my equipment, my research, the—"

"We'll move everything," Riley said immediately. "Whatever you need. We'll make multiple trips if necessary. Nothing gets left behind that matters to you."

"Isa's place has storage," Isa added. "And we can set up a proper workshop area. Better than what you have now, honestly. Real workspace, real tools, real lighting."

Kyr4n looked at his hands—the circuit board forgotten, tools scattered across the makeshift table. Looked at the exposed workshop area that left him feeling perpetually vulnerable. Looked at Isa and Riley, both watching him with patience and hope.

"What if I'm too much?" he asked quietly. "Too difficult. Too... broken."

"You're not broken," Isa said fiercely. "You're careful. You're cautious. You've learned to protect yourself because no one else would. That's not broken—that's survival."

"And if you are too much—which you won't be—then we'll figure it out." Riley's smile was warm. "That's what people do. They figure things out together."

Kyr4n felt something crack in his chest—not breaking, but opening. The careful walls he'd built, brick by defensive brick, showing their first fractures.

"I need time," he said finally. "To think. To... process."

"Okay." Isa squeezed his hand. "How much time?"

"I don't know. A few days? A week?"

"Take the time you need," Riley said. "But Kyr4n? Really think about it. Not just about what could go wrong, but what could go right."

"And in the meantime," Isa added, "you're coming to my place for dinner tonight. No arguments. You need actual food and actual rest, and I'm not letting you disappear underground for another three days."

"Isa—"

"No arguments," she repeated firmly. "This isn't negotiable. You'll come over, we'll eat, maybe Riley can join us—" she glanced at him questioningly.

"I'd love to," Riley confirmed.

"—and you can go back to your hideout after if you really want. But you're not skipping meals and avoiding people just because you're scared."

Kyr4n wanted to argue. Wanted to insist he was fine, that he didn't need their care, that he could manage alone like he always had.

But sitting here with both of them, feeling the genuine concern and affection radiating from them, the arguments felt hollow.

"Okay," he said quietly. "Dinner."

Isa's smile was radiant. "Good. Seven o'clock. And Kyry?"

"Yeah?"

"I mean it about the moving in thing. Real offer. When you're ready." Her hand found his face, thumb brushing his cheek. "You don't have to live like that anymore."

Riley stood, gathering his empty cup. "I should get going. Got one more delivery to make." He touched Kyr4n's shoulder briefly—warm, solid, grounding. "See you tonight, yeah?"

"Yeah," Kyr4n managed.

They left together, Isa throwing him one last warm look before disappearing into the street crowd. Kyr4n sat alone at his makeshift workstation, staring at the half-repaired comm unit without really seeing it.

Living with Isa. Proper workspace. Real bed. Support instead of isolation.

Riley included somehow, part of the picture even if the details were unclear.

The three of them.

His hands found the circuit board again, but his mind was forty meters underground, cataloging everything in his hideout. Everything that would need to move. Everything that would change.

Everything that could go right.

He picked up his tools and got back to work, but something had shifted. The concrete walls of his hideout felt a little less like protection and a little more like a prison he'd built himself.

Maybe it was time to find out what life looked like outside.
