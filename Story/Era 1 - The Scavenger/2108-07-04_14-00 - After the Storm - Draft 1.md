---

Riley had been sitting in the same corner booth for twenty minutes, his third cup of tea going cold while he watched the entrance with an intensity that probably looked suspicious to the other patrons. His messenger bag sat on the seat beside him, fingers drumming an anxious rhythm on the table's scarred surface.

The message had finally come through this morning: _I'm fine. Let's meet. Same cafe, 14:00._

Fine. Two days of silence, two days of imagining every possible disaster, and she sent _I'm fine_.

He'd been halfway through a delivery run to Sector 9 when the riot started. By the time he'd gotten the news, turned around, and raced back to The Cluster, the whole district had been locked down tight. Corporate checkpoints everywhere, no passage without authorization. He'd tried messaging Isa—dozens of times. Nothing. Radio silence.

Kyr4n would be underground, Riley had told himself during those endless hours. Kyr4n would retreat to his hideout, wait it out. Kyr4n would be safe.

But Isa lived in The Stack, right in the middle of the chaos zone. Isa who was fearless and stubborn and wouldn't run from a fight even when she absolutely should.

The door opened.

Riley was on his feet before he consciously registered the movement, crossing the small cafe in three strides. Isa barely had time to turn toward him before he pulled her into a fierce, quiet hug.

"Fuck," he breathed into her hair. "I was so worried."

Her arms came up around him, solid and real. "I know. I'm sorry. I couldn't—"

"You're okay?" He pulled back just enough to look at her, hands on her shoulders, searching for injuries. A small cut near her hairline, mostly healed. Some fading bruises on her forearms visible beneath her jacket sleeves. "You're really okay?"

"I'm really okay." Her smile was warm, understanding his panic. "Breathe, courier boy."

He huffed a laugh that was almost a sob, pulling her in again. Just holding her. Confirming she was solid, safe, here.

After a long moment, Isa gently extracted herself. "Come on. Let's sit. I'll tell you everything."

They claimed his corner booth, Isa ordering tea while Riley tried to get his heart rate back under control. Now that the initial relief was fading, he could see the details—the careful way she moved, favoring her right side slightly. The exhaustion around her eyes that good sleep hadn't quite erased.

"Start from the beginning," he said quietly.

Isa wrapped her hands around her cup when it arrived, breathing in the steam. "You heard about the EMP?"

"Bits and pieces. Corporate mech got fried, shit went sideways fast."

"That's putting it mildly." She took a sip. "I was at the market with Kyr4n. Everything was normal, then suddenly there's this pulse, the whole sector's grid just... dies. Panic everywhere. Corporate backup arrived in minutes—full tactical teams, the works."

Riley's jaw tightened. "And you got caught in it."

"Got pushed into a wall during the evacuation stampede." She touched her side lightly. "Cracked rib, concussion, some other bruises. Could've been worse."

"Could've been better." His voice came out rougher than intended.

"Hey." Her hand found his across the table. "I'm okay. And I had help."

"Kyr4n?"

"Kyr4n." Something shifted in her expression—warmth, wonder, maybe a bit of residual shock. "Riley, he brought me to his hideout."

Riley blinked. "His... the utility room?"

"The ventilation shaft forty meters underground that he's been hiding in like some kind of tech-savvy mole person, yeah." Isa's smile was soft. "He broke his biggest rule for me. Let me into his secret sanctuary."

The significance of that settled over Riley slowly. Kyr4n, who flinched from casual touch. Kyr4n, who disappeared when conversations got too personal. Kyr4n, who guarded his space and his secrets like they were the only things keeping him alive.

"Wow," Riley said quietly. "That's... that's huge for him."

"I know." Isa's fingers tightened around her cup. "I was half-conscious, bleeding, and he just... grabbed me. Pulled me through this insane maze of tunnels to safety. Patched me up, let me stay until things calmed down."

"How long?"

"Two days underground." She met his eyes. "No comm signal down there. That's why I couldn't message you. I'm sorry—I know you must have been going crazy."

"You could say that." Riley managed a small smile. "But I'm glad he was there. Glad you were safe."

"Safe, yeah." Isa's expression turned mischievous. "And not exactly alone."

Riley's eyebrows rose. "Oh?"

"Two days in a two-by-four meter space, Riley. Very close quarters. Very... intimate proximity."

Understanding dawned. Riley felt something twist in his chest—not quite jealousy, but close. "You and Kyr4n."

"Me and Kyr4n." She wasn't shy about it, watching his reaction carefully. "Want to hear about it?"

He should say no. Should deflect, change subjects, maintain some kind of boundary. Instead, he heard himself say, "Yeah, actually."

Isa's smile turned warm, appreciative. "So. First night, we're both wired on adrenaline, coming down from the chaos. I'm patched up, he's pretending he's not freaking out about having someone in his space. We're talking—really talking, you know? About our lives, our shit, everything."

Riley leaned forward, drawn in despite himself.

"And somewhere around three in the morning, I just... kissed him." Isa's eyes were bright with the memory. "Just went for it. Figured if he didn't want it, he'd pull away."

"He didn't pull away."

"He didn't pull away." Her smile was almost proud. "Kissed me back like he'd been thinking about it for weeks and finally got permission. It was..." She paused, searching for words. "Intense. Careful. Like he was afraid of doing it wrong, but also couldn't stop himself."

Riley's throat felt tight. "And then?"

"And then we had very creative sex in a very confined space." Isa laughed at his expression. "What? You asked."

"I did." He couldn't help grinning despite the odd ache in his chest. "Was he... I mean, how was it?"

"Fucking amazing, actually." Isa didn't hesitate. "Turns out all that careful precision he uses on electronics? Translates really well to other activities. Very attentive. Very responsive to feedback. And once he relaxed..." She fanned herself dramatically. "Let's just say the man has unexpected skills."

Riley laughed, genuine and warm, even as something in him whispered _I should have been there_. "That good, huh?"

"That good." Isa studied him over her tea. "You're jealous."

It wasn't a question. Riley considered denying it, then decided honesty was easier. "Maybe a little."

"Of me or him?"

"Yes." He met her eyes directly. "Both."

Isa's expression softened. "Riley..."

"No, it's okay." He ran a hand through his hair. "I knew you two had something building. And I'm happy for you—genuinely. I just..." He trailed off, not quite sure how to articulate the feeling.

"You wish you'd been there," Isa supplied gently.

"Yeah." The admission felt vulnerable. "Missed the occasion, I guess."

"Well." Isa reached across the table, lacing her fingers with his. "For what it's worth, I missed you. Both of us did, actually. Kyr4n mentioned you—asked if I knew where you were, if you were safe."

Warmth spread through Riley's chest. "He did?"

"Mmhmm. I think he wishes things had gone differently too. That it wasn't just... crisis circumstances forcing everything."

They sat in comfortable silence for a moment, hands linked across the table. Riley processed this new reality—Kyr4n and Isa together, himself on the outside looking in but somehow still part of the picture.

"So," he said eventually, "how's he doing now? After everything?"

Isa's expression clouded. "That's the thing. He's back in that fucking hole."

"The hideout?"

"The hideout." She said it with barely restrained frustration. "Riley, you should see this place. It's not viable for anyone, let alone long-term. Two meters by four meters, concrete walls, no windows, barely any ventilation. He's been living like that for months. Maybe years."

Riley had imagined the space based on Kyr4n's rare descriptions, but hearing the reality laid out made his chest tighten. "That bad?"

"Worse." Isa's fingers drummed on the table. "I want to drag him out of there. Force him into actual living conditions if I have to."

"Would he come?"

"I don't know. He's so stubborn about his independence, his security." She met Riley's eyes. "But my place would be comfortable for both of us. Actual space, actual bed, actual furniture. I could take care of him properly instead of watching him retreat to that concrete coffin every night."

"Have you told him this?"

"Not yet. Wanted to let things settle first, make sure the city calmed down." Isa squeezed his hand. "But I will. Soon. He deserves better than that hole."

"He does," Riley agreed quietly. Then, because the thought had been building: "What about me?"

Isa's eyebrows rose. "What about you?"

"If you get him moved in. If you two are... together." He stumbled over the words slightly. "Where does that leave us? The thing we were building?"

Her smile was radiant. "Riley. You think I'd cut you out?"

"I don't know. I'm just the courier who flirts too much."

"You're not." Isa said it firmly. "You're someone we both care about. Someone who makes us both feel..." She searched for the word. "Lighter. Real. Like there's more to life than just survival."

"We?" Riley's heart picked up speed.

"We." Isa confirmed. "I can't speak for Kyr4n's feelings entirely—he's still figuring himself out. But I know he values you. Trusts you. And I know I want you around. If you're interested in... whatever this is becoming."

Riley looked at her—hazel eyes bright with gold flecks, expression open and honest. Thought about Kyr4n in his underground hideout, brilliant and broken and somehow trusting them both. Thought about the three of them, the weird triangle they were forming without quite meaning to.

"I'm interested," he said quietly. "Very interested."

"Good." Isa's smile was radiant. "Because I have plans. Get Kyr4n out of that hole, set up proper living space, and maybe..." She let the thought hang, suggestive.

"Maybe?"

"Maybe see where things go. The three of us." She said it casually, but Riley caught the hope underneath. "If you're open to that."

Riley thought about it for maybe half a second. "I'm open to that."

"Even though you missed the first round?"

"Pretty sure there'll be other opportunities." He grinned. "If I'm reading this right."

Isa laughed, that warm high-pitched sound that made other patrons glance over. "Oh, courier boy. You're definitely reading it right."

They finished their tea in comfortable quiet, hands still linked across the table. Around them, The Cluster hummed with post-riot recovery—people rebuilding, reclaiming their space, moving forward.

"When are you going to tell him?" Riley asked eventually. "About moving in with you?"

"Soon." Isa's expression turned determined. "He needs to know he has options. That he doesn't have to live like that anymore." She paused. "Want to come with me? When I do?"

"Really?"

"Really. I think he'd appreciate the support. And you should see the place—know what we're working with if you're going to be part of this."

Riley's chest felt warm, full. "Yeah. I'd like that."

"Saturday, then." Isa stood, pulling him up with her. "Come to my place around mid-afternoon. We'll make a plan, then go collect our brilliant wounded bird together."

"Saturday," Riley confirmed.

She kissed him then—quick and warm and promising, right there in the cafe. When she pulled back, her smile was radiant.

"It's going to be good, Riley. The three of us. I can feel it."

"Yeah," he said, still tasting tea and possibility. "Me too."

She left with a wave, disappearing into the afternoon crowd. Riley sat back down, his own smile impossible to suppress.

The three of them. Kyr4n and Isa and him.

People like us, he thought. Nice, smart, attractive people who watched out for each other.

Yeah. He could definitely work with that.
