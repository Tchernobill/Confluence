## Writer's Notes

- **Purpose in Arc**: Essential transition scene that moves Kyr4n from private to public sphere while establishing the harsh world he navigates. Demonstrates survival skills and world knowledge that justify his isolated competence.

- **Potential Revisions**: 
  - May need to adjust tunnel navigation length based on pacing
  - Consider adding brief encounter with another tunnel traveler (declined interaction showing isolation)
  - Ensure balance between showing competence and genuine danger

- **Inspiration / References**: 
  - Blade Runner's urban decay and rain-soaked streets
  - Metro 2033's underground navigation and hazards
  - Neuromancer's description of Ninsei street life
  - The Wire's Baltimore street navigation awareness

- **Questions to Resolve**: 
  - Exact tunnel route specifications for future consistency?
  - Specific gang markers and their meanings?
  - Market entrance exact location and concealment method?
  - What vendor credentials/recognition signals does he use?
  - How many alternative routes does he know?
