Kyr4n stood outside Isa's container unit, hand raised to knock, paralyzed by the simple absurdity of the moment. He'd been here before—spent two days here, in fact, sleeping in her bed and using her shower and existing in her space like it was almost normal. But that had been aftermath. Crisis mode. This was... intentional. Social. He was here for _dinner_, which somehow felt more intimate than everything that had come before.

The door opened before he could knock.

"Kyry." Isa's smile was warm, understanding his hesitation without him having to voice it. "Come in. Riley's already here."

Right. Riley was here. Both of them. Together. This was happening.

He stepped inside, and the contrast to his hideout hit him again even though he'd experienced it before. Space. Actual space to move without constantly calculating clearances. Isa's fabric-covered walls creating warmth. The smell of actual cooking—something with garlic and spices that made his stomach clench with hunger he'd been ignoring.

Riley was in the kitchen area, sleeves rolled up, doing something at the hotplate. He looked up at Kyr4n's entrance, and his smile was easy, welcoming.

"Hey. Hope you like stir-fry. It's pretty much the only thing I can make that won't poison anyone."

"Riley's been helping," Isa said, guiding Kyr4n further inside with a hand on his lower back. "Turns out he's actually useful in a kitchen."

"High praise," Riley said dryly. "She's just glad someone else knows how to operate a hotplate."

"I can operate a hotplate," Isa protested. "I just choose not to when there are willing victims around."

The banter was light, comfortable. Kyr4n stood in the middle of the space, feeling like he'd walked into a scene he didn't know the script for. Domestic. This was domestic, and he had no framework for it.

"Sit," Isa said, nudging him toward the couch. "Food's almost ready. Want something to drink? I've got water, some questionable beer, and tea if you want."

"Water's fine." His voice came out quieter than intended.

She poured him a cup, then settled beside him on the couch—close but not crowding, her warmth a solid presence. "You okay?"

"Yeah. Just... this is different."

"Different how?"

He gestured vaguely at the space. "Normal. It's normal. People just... do this?"

Isa's expression softened. "Yeah, Kyry. People do this. They have friends over, make food together, exist in the same space without crisis driving it."

"Weird," he muttered.

She laughed, the sound warm and genuine. "Only you would find basic social interaction weird."

"It is weird," he insisted. "There are protocols I don't understand. Timing. What you're supposed to do with your hands when you're not working on something."

"Well, right now you're supposed to sit there and let us feed you." Riley approached with three mismatched plates balanced carefully. "And maybe relax. Novel concept, I know."

The plates were set on the low table—actual food, more than ration bars and salvaged protein packs. Rice, vegetables, something that might be actual chicken or a decent synthetic approximation. Kyr4n stared at it.

"This is too much," he said quietly.

"It's dinner," Isa said. "A normal amount of dinner."

"For my hideout budget, this is a week's worth of—"

"Kyry." Riley sat in one of the chairs, his own plate balanced on his knee. "Just eat. Let someone take care of you for once."

The words hit harder than they should have. Kyr4n picked up the fork—actual fork, not disposable—and took a bite. The flavors were almost overwhelming after weeks of bland survival rations. He had to stop himself from eating too fast, from betraying just how hungry he actually was.

They ate in comfortable quiet for a while, Riley and Isa exchanging small comments about ingredients and preparation while Kyr4n focused on the simple mechanics of the meal. It should have been awkward—this intimate triangle of proximity and care—but somehow it wasn't. Somehow it felt almost... right.

"So," Riley said eventually, "I've been meaning to ask. That droid head project you're working on. How's that coming?"

Kyr4n looked up, surprised. "You know about that?"

"Isa mentioned it. And I saw some of the components in your workspace that day you fixed my bike." Riley's expression was curious, interested. "Seems ambitious."

"It is." Kyr4n set down his fork, hands finding more comfortable territory—talking about work. "Trying to establish neural network integration. It's... complicated. The consciousness architecture alone requires—"

He caught himself, aware he was about to launch into technical details that would lose them both.

But Isa was leaning forward, interested. "No, keep going. I want to hear this."

"Really?"

"Really." She settled more comfortably. "You've been working on this for months and I've barely heard the technical side. What makes it so complicated?"

So he explained. Not dumbing down, not simplifying, just... sharing what he was working on. Riley asked questions that showed he was actually listening, actually trying to understand. Isa chimed in with observations about the underground tech trade that related to his component needs. And somewhere in the conversation, Kyr4n realized his shoulders had relaxed, his hands had stopped their constant fidgeting.

He was comfortable. With both of them. Simultaneously.

When had that happened?

"You should meet him," Kyr4n said suddenly. "Sedh. When he's more... stable. Once I finish the body integration."

Riley's eyebrows rose. "You named it?"

"Him," Kyr4n corrected automatically. "And yeah. Sedh. It's... he chose it himself, actually. Or, he will choose it. The consciousness is developing faster than expected. He's already showing preference patterns."

"That's incredible," Isa said softly. "You're creating an AI consciousness."

"I'm liberating one." The distinction mattered to him. "He was already there, just... trapped. Incomplete. I'm just giving him the tools to become fully himself."

"Still incredible." Riley's smile was warm. "And I'd like to meet him. When you're ready."

The conversation drifted—work, courier routes, underground market rumors, the slow recovery after the riots. Isa refilled water cups. Riley helped clear plates. Kyr4n found himself relaxing further into the couch, watching them move around each other with easy familiarity.

"Come on," Isa said eventually, tugging Kyr4n's hand. "Let's sit properly. My ass is going numb from this couch."

She pulled him down to the floor, backs against the couch, legs stretched out. Riley joined them without hesitation, the three of them arranged in a loose line with Isa in the middle. Close enough that Kyr4n could feel body heat on his left, hear Riley's breathing on Isa's other side.

"This is nice," Riley said quietly. "The three of us like this."

"Yeah," Isa agreed. Her hand found Kyr4n's on the floor between them, fingers threading together. "It is."

Kyr4n's chest felt tight—not with anxiety, but with something else. Something that might be contentment, if he knew what that felt like.

"I've been thinking," he said quietly. "About what you said earlier. The moving in thing."

Isa's hand tightened on his. "Yeah?"

"I'm still scared," he admitted. "Terrified, actually. But..." He looked around the space—the actual furniture, the warmth, the two people flanking him like anchors. "Maybe being terrified isn't a good enough reason to stay in a concrete hole."

"No pressure," Riley said. "Whatever you decide, we support it."

"But if you did want to try," Isa added carefully, "we could do it gradually. Move some things over. Spend a few nights here. See how it feels."

"What about..." Kyr4n gestured vaguely at Riley. "Where does... I mean, how does this work? The three of us?"

"However we want it to work," Riley said simply. "I'm not trying to insert myself into something that's just you and Isa. But if there's space for..." He trailed off, seemingly unsure how to finish.

"There's space," Isa said firmly. "If everyone wants there to be space."

Kyr4n processed this. The implications. The possibility. "I don't know how to do this," he said again. "This... whatever this is becoming."

"None of us do," Riley pointed out. "We're all figuring it out as we go."

"That's not very reassuring."

"No," Isa agreed, "but it's honest." She leaned her head against Kyr4n's shoulder. "We'll figure it out together. Make mistakes, fix them, adapt. Like debugging code."

"That's a terrible metaphor."

"It's a perfect metaphor and you know it." Her smile pressed against his shoulder. "So? Want to try? Stay here tonight, see how it feels?"

Kyr4n looked at the space—at Isa's actual bed visible in the sleeping area, at Riley watching him with patient understanding, at the simple domestic comfort of the evening they'd just shared.

"Okay," he said quietly. "Trial run. One night."

"One night," Isa confirmed. Then, with a mischievous glint: "Riley, you staying too?"

Riley's eyebrows rose. "I mean... I could head out, give you two space—"

"Or you could stay," Isa said. "Couch is actually pretty comfortable. If you want."

The offer hung in the air. Kyr4n felt Riley's surprise through Isa's body language, felt his own reaction—not rejection, but curiosity. Interest. Possibility.

"If Kyr4n's okay with it," Riley said carefully.

They both looked at him. Kyr4n processed—the implications, the intimacy, the strange rightness of all three of them in this space together.

"Yeah," he said finally. "Stay."

Riley's smile was radiant. "Okay then."

They sat in comfortable silence, three people learning the geography of each other. Eventually, Isa started telling a story about a particularly difficult implant client, and Riley countered with a courier disaster tale, and Kyr4n found himself almost laughing at their theatrical storytelling.

This. This was what normal people did. Sat together, shared food, told stories, existed without crisis or purpose or defensive positioning.

It was terrifying and strange and somehow felt more like home than his concrete hideout ever had.

Later—after more talking, after Isa showed Riley where bedding was stored, after Kyr4n accepted that yes, he was actually staying—they settled into the sleeping arrangements. Isa pulled Kyr4n toward her bed, and he went, still uncertain but willing.

"Riley's fine on the couch," she murmured. "But having you here..." She kissed him softly. "This is better."

"Yeah," Kyr4n agreed quietly. "It is."

He lay in her actual bed, in actual space, listening to her breathing beside him and Riley settling on the couch beyond. Three people in one container unit. Three people who'd somehow found each other in the chaos of the Slum and decided to hold on.

His hideout waited forty meters underground—secure, isolated, familiar.

But for the first time, Kyr4n thought he might be willing to let it go.
