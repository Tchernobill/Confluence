## Writer's Notes

- **Purpose in Arc**: Critical scene that introduces Sedh and establishes Kyr4n's relationship with technology as deeper than relationships with people. Sets up entire consciousness emergence storyline spanning multiple tomes.

- **Potential Revisions**: 
  - Consider adding one more small sensory detail during basement exploration
  - May want to adjust pacing of discovery moment
  - Consider whether "unfamiliar flutter" is too overt in signaling importance

- **Inspiration / References**: 
  - Stalker (Tarkovsky) for meditative exploration atmosphere
  - Real Montreal incinerator (Incinérateur des Carrières) for building design
  - Urban exploration photography for authentic decay details
  - Ghost in the Shell for technology-as-character relationship

- **Questions to Resolve**: 
  - Should we know more about previous owner of android head?
  - How long has the building been abandoned?
  - Are there other scavengers who know about this location?
