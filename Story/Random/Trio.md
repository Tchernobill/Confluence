DO NOT USE for prod hahaha



The shower's steam filled the bathroom with humid heat, water cascading from multiple jets in the enhanced facility's luxury setup. Kyr4n stood under the central spray, letting the hot water work against muscles still tense from the day's operations, when the glass door slid open.

Zara entered first, her compact frame moving with predatory grace even in nakedness. Water immediately began to darken her black hair, plastering it against her skull and emphasizing the sharp angles of her face. Her dark eyes fixed on him with unmistakable intent as droplets ran down her olive skin, following the lines of her small scars.

Isa followed seconds later, her softer curves a contrast to Zara's lean muscle. The hot spray hit her pale skin, immediately flushing it pink across her chest and shoulders. Her breathing quickened as steam swirled around them, pupils dilating in the humid atmosphere.

Without words, Zara moved behind Kyr4n, her hands spreading across his shoulder blades where water had pooled. Her touch was firm, possessive, fingers tracing the enhanced ridges along his spine with clinical precision. When she found the sensitive spot where his neck met his shoulders, his head tilted back slightly, jaw tensing as sensation shot through his modified nerves.

Isa approached from the front, her hands finding his chest, palms flat against his pecs. Water ran between her fingers as she explored the defined muscle, her lips parting as she felt his heart rate accelerate under her touch. Her face showed pure fascination, eyebrows slightly raised as she discovered how the enhancement had changed even familiar territory.

Zara's mouth found his neck, lips and teeth working against the pulse point. The sensation made his nostrils flare, a barely audible intake of breath as her tongue traced the tendon. Her hands moved lower, mapping his back with the thoroughness of someone conducting reconnaissance.

Steam condensed on the glass around them as heat built in more ways than one. Isa's exploration grew bolder, her fingers tracing downward, following the path water took as it ran over his abs. When she reached his navel, her breathing became shallow, small puffs of vapor visible in the humid air.

Zara's hands guided Isa's exploration, positioning her palms against his ribs while maintaining her own grip on his shoulders. Her dark eyes gleamed with satisfaction as she orchestrated their movements, mouth curved in a small smile even as water ran down her face.

"Feel here," Zara murmured, her voice echoing off the wet tiles as she placed Isa's hand against his chest where enhancement ran deepest. "Press."

Isa's face transformed as she followed the instruction—her eyes widening, lips forming a small 'o' of surprise as she felt his body respond. The pressure sent visible tension through his frame, his abs contracting as enhanced nerves fired. A low sound escaped his throat, barely audible over the water's spray.

But Kyr4n's patience with Zara's control had limits. His hands suddenly gripped her wrists, pinning them against the shower wall behind him. The change was immediate—her eyes went wide, pupils dilating as her carefully maintained dominance cracked. A sharp gasp escaped her lips as he turned within the circle of their arms, water streaming down his face as he looked down at her.

"My turn," he said quietly, his voice carrying an authority that made both women shiver despite the hot water.

Zara's reaction was immediate and visceral. Her mouth fell open, breathing becoming rapid as she pressed back against the tiles. The loss of control she craved was written across her features—eyebrows furrowing, dark eyes growing unfocused as he maintained his grip on her wrists.

Isa moved closer, drawn by the shift in dynamic. Her hands found his back, exploring the muscles that tensed as he held Zara pinned. Her face showed complete abandon to the moment, business-minded control dissolving as she pressed her breasts against his side, nipples hardening from the heat and anticipation.

Kyr4n's free hand traced down Zara's throat, thumb pressing gently against her pulse point. The simple touch made her arch against the wall, a broken moan echoing off the tiles. Her usual tactical precision was nowhere to be found—replaced by raw need as she tilted her head back, offering her neck completely.

"This is what you need, isn't it?" he murmured against her ear, his enhanced awareness reading every micro-expression, every change in her breathing.

Zara's response was wordless—a desperate nod as her hips pressed forward, seeking contact. Her face contorted with want, the careful mask completely stripped away by his dominance.

Isa's hands moved lower, finding his cock as water provided natural lubrication. Her fingers wrapped around his length, stroking with growing confidence as she watched his effect on Zara. Her face showed complete concentration, business precision giving way to sensual focus as she felt him respond to her touch.

The steam made every sensation more intense, skin hypersensitive from heat and moisture. Kyr4n positioned Zara exactly where he wanted her, one hand still pinning her wrists while the other guided her leg up around his hip. Her breathing became ragged, small desperate sounds escaping as he controlled the pace completely.

Isa knelt on the shower's built-in bench, water cascading over her back as she took him into her mouth. Her abandon was total—eyes closing as she lost herself to the sensation, soft moans vibrating against his skin. Her hands gripped his thighs for balance as the wet environment made everything slippery.

Zara watched with desperate fascination, her dark eyes fixed on Isa's mouth. The sight made her breathing even more erratic, hips moving involuntarily as Kyr4n's grip kept her exactly where he wanted her. When he finally entered her, her back arched off the wall, a guttural cry echoing off the bathroom tiles.

The rhythm built with deliberate intensity. Kyr4n's control was absolute—setting the pace, the depth, the angle while both women responded to his lead. Isa's mouth worked with increasing urgency, her face flushed with steam and arousal. Zara's careful composure shattered completely, her face showing nothing but raw need as she submitted entirely to his dominance.

Water continued to cascade over their intertwined bodies as the intensity escalated. Isa's coordination became instinctive, hands and mouth working purely on desire. Zara's tactical control was completely gone, her head thrown back against the tile as broken gasps and moans filled the steamy air.

When climax approached, it was visible in their faces before it hit their bodies. Isa's features went slack, eyes unfocused as sensation overwhelmed thought. Zara's jaw clenched, her whole body tensing as she fought the inevitable until Kyr4n's command finally pushed her over the edge. His own composed mask cracked as enhanced senses amplified everything beyond manageable levels.

The culmination was explosive—bodies shuddering against slick tile, cries echoing off bathroom walls, water continuing to cascade over trembling limbs. In the aftermath, they remained pressed together under the spray, steam slowly clearing as breathing returned to normal and hypersensitive skin gradually calmed.

The shower's multiple jets continued their steady rhythm, washing away the evidence while leaving the memory of heat, steam, and complete surrender to desire.

# Round Two

The transition from shower to bedroom happened in a tangle of still-damp limbs and hungry mouths. Steam clung to their skin as they fell onto the king-sized bed, sheets cool against their heated bodies. The city's neon glow filtered through the smart-glass, painting them in shades of electric blue and amber.

Isa landed on her back, dark hair spread across the pillows as she looked up at them with eyes still glazed from the shower. Her chest rose and fell rapidly, nipples hard from the temperature change. Water droplets still clung to her pale skin, and she made no move to dry them—too lost in the moment to care about anything beyond sensation.

Zara positioned herself beside Isa, but her attention was entirely on Kyr4n as he knelt between them. Her dark eyes tracked his every movement with predatory focus, but there was submission in the way she waited for his lead. Her compact body still trembled slightly from their encounter in the shower, skin flushed and hypersensitive.

Kyr4n's enhanced awareness cataloged their every response—Isa's pupils still dilated with abandon, Zara's breathing pattern showing she was ready for more despite their recent climax. His own body responded to their obvious need, cock hardening again as he looked down at them.

"Not finished yet," he said quietly, his voice carrying that authority that made Zara's breath catch.

Isa's response was immediate—her back arched off the bed, one hand reaching for him while the other gripped the sheets. "Please," she whispered, the word barely audible but filled with desperate need.

Zara's reaction was more controlled but no less intense. Her jaw tightened, hands clenching into fists as she fought the urge to take charge. The internal battle was visible on her face—the tactical part of her wanting to orchestrate, the deeper part craving his complete dominance.

Kyr4n moved with deliberate slowness, his hands tracing down Isa's torso first. Her skin was still warm and damp, hypersensitive from their earlier encounter. When his fingers brushed her nipples, she gasped sharply, hips lifting off the bed in automatic response.

"Watch," he told Zara, his voice low but commanding.

Zara's eyes fixed on his hands as they explored Isa's body, her own breathing becoming shallow. She could see every micro-expression that crossed Isa's face—the way her eyebrows furrowed when his touch became more intense, how her mouth fell open when he found particularly sensitive spots.

Isa's abandon was total. Her business-minded control had completely dissolved, leaving only pure response to sensation. When Kyr4n's mouth followed the path his hands had traced, her back arched dramatically, a broken moan escaping her lips. Her fingers tangled in his hair, not to guide but to anchor herself.

But Kyr4n's attention wasn't exclusively on Isa. His free hand found Zara's thigh, fingers tracing patterns that made her shiver. The touch was possessive, claiming, and her dark eyes squeezed shut as she fought not to lose control completely.

"Your turn," he murmured against Isa's skin, but his eyes were on Zara.

The assassin's composure cracked immediately. She moved toward him with desperate urgency, but he caught her wrists before she could take charge. The familiar grip made her breath stutter, pupils dilating as submission warred with her need to control.

"Lie down," he commanded, and the authority in his voice made both women respond viscerally.

Zara complied immediately, settling beside Isa on the rumpled sheets. Her face showed the effort it took to surrender control, jaw clenched as she forced herself to wait for his lead. But her hips moved restlessly, betraying her need despite her attempts at patience.

Isa turned to watch, her face still flushed with arousal. Her hand found Zara's, fingers interlacing as they both focused on Kyr4n with hungry anticipation. The simple contact grounded them both—two women sharing the same overwhelming desire.

Kyr4n positioned himself above Zara, his weight supported on his forearms as he looked down at her. Her breathing became rapid and shallow, dark eyes wide as she waited to see what he would do. When he finally entered her, her back arched off the bed, a sharp cry echoing through the room.

The rhythm he set was deliberate, controlled—deep strokes that made Zara's face contort with pleasure. Her usual tactical precision was nowhere to be found, replaced by raw need as she responded to his dominance. Small, desperate sounds escaped her lips with each movement.

Isa watched with fascination, her free hand moving down her own body as arousal built again. Her face showed complete absorption in the sight of Zara's submission, her own breathing becoming erratic as she touched herself.

"Feel how wet you are," Kyr4n murmured to Zara, his enhanced senses reading her every response. "This is what you need."

Zara's only response was a broken whimper, her head thrown back against the pillows. The acknowledgment of her need for submission was written across her features—vulnerability mixed with desperate gratitude that he understood what she craved.

Kyr4n's adaptability showed in how he read both women's responses. When Isa's soft moans indicated she was approaching climax from her own touch, he adjusted his rhythm with Zara to match. When Zara's breathing pattern showed she was close to the edge, he controlled the pace to keep her exactly where he wanted her.

The intensity built steadily. Isa's abandon deepened until she was writhing beside them, her face slack with pleasure as she lost herself completely to sensation. Zara's submission became total, her body responding to Kyr4n's every movement while her mind surrendered all control.

"Come for me," Kyr4n commanded, his voice rough with his own approaching climax.

The words triggered an immediate response. Zara's body convulsed, her face contorting as orgasm crashed over her. Isa followed seconds later, her back arching as her own climax hit. Kyr4n's control finally broke, his composed mask cracking as he buried himself deep in Zara's heat.

The aftermath was a tangle of sweat-slicked limbs and ragged breathing. Zara lay boneless beneath him, her face peaceful in a way it rarely was—the tactical mask completely gone. Isa curled against his side, her features soft with satisfaction and complete exhaustion.

In the neon-lit darkness, surrounded by the distant hum of the cyberpunk city, they had created something that transcended the corporate dystopia outside. Connection. Trust. The radical act of choosing vulnerability in a world built on armor and enhancement.

Round two had been different from the shower—deeper, more intense, with surrender that went beyond the physical. As sleep began to claim them, still intertwined among the rumpled sheets, the promise of more hung in the air like electricity waiting to spark.
