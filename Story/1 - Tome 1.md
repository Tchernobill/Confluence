## Structural Elements

**Tome Opening**: Kyr4n wakes in his concrete utility room hideout, emphasizing his isolation and survival-focused existence. Mood: Gritty, solitary, cyberpunk atmosphere of urban decay.

**Tome Climax**: The confrontation over Sedh's personhood when Isa views him as "just technology" while Kyr4n insists on treating the android as a person with rights and autonomy. This forces a philosophical and emotional reckoning about consciousness, freedom, and relationships.

**Tome Resolution**: Phoenix Recovery officially opens with a line of clients, representing Kyr4n's transformation from isolated scavenger to successful artisan. However, Isa's observation that Kyr4n shows more connection to Sedh than to any human hints at future complications.

**Tome Mood/Tone Evolution**: 
- **Opening**: Gritty isolation, survival-focused, cyberpunk dystopia
- **Middle**: Tentative connection, philosophical exploration, growing warmth
- **Ending**: Cautious optimism, legitimate success, but underlying emotional barriers remain

**Transition to Next Tome**: Phoenix Recovery's success and Kyr4n's growing reputation will attract Frank's attention for the corporate heist, while the deep relationships established here will be tested by the viral infection in Tome 2.
