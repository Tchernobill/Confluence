# The Takeover

The elevator's grinding ascent through layers of urban decay provided Kyr4n with eighteen floors of mechanical white noise to organize his thoughts. The building's electromagnetic signature painted itself across his enhanced senses—surveillance networks, weapon detectors, communication arrays—all catalogued and filed away without conscious effort. The virus-enhanced neural pathways processed information with the same unconscious efficiency his lungs processed air.

Marcus, Rico's bodyguard, shifted his weight as chrome-plated muscle fibres adjusted to the elevator's subtle vibrations. Standard street-level augmentation—expensive enough to impress civilians, crude enough to broadcast its limitations to anyone with real technical knowledge.

"Mr. Vasquez is expecting you," Marcus said as the doors opened onto the twelfth floor. "He's... conducting business right now. You'll need to wait until he's finished."

But Kyr4n had already heard the sounds filtering through the reinforced security doors. Not quite screaming—something more complex. The desperate performance of someone trying to survive by convincing their tormentor that brutality was pleasure.

His enhanced hearing parsed the acoustic signature with clinical precision: impact patterns, vocal stress indicators, the wet sound of blood on expensive fabric. His face remained expressionless as Marcus led him through corridors that reeked of industrial disinfectant layered over decades of human desperation.

The doors to Rico's office opened to reveal a scene that crystallized everything predictable about small-time criminal operations. Rico "The Grip" Vasquez—a man whose reputation rested on knowing exactly how much pressure to apply before bones cracked—was engaged in what he probably considered recreation. The woman beneath him displayed fresh contusions that spoke of calculated violence designed to maximize suffering without reducing "productivity."

Two other women occupied chairs positioned for optimal viewing, their faces carefully blank with the practiced invisibility of long-term survival.

"Ah, our famous craftsman!" Rico called out without interrupting his rhythm, his voice carrying the theatrical cruelty of someone who'd built his identity around causing pain. "Give me just a moment to finish breaking this one in properly—nothing like drawing a little blood to tighten up the merchandise, you know?"

He emphasized the point with a casual backhand that sent droplets across polished wood furniture. The woman's sob hung in the air like a discordant note in expensive acoustics.

"You should have a go when I'm done with her," Rico continued, finally separating from his victim with exaggerated satisfaction. "Quality goods, though she's still learning to show proper appreciation for her position."

Kyr4n stood in the doorway, processing the scene with the same detached analysis he'd once applied to damaged electronics. His face revealed nothing—not disgust, not anger, not judgment. Just the flat assessment of someone cataloguing system failures.

Then Rico made his mistake.

"Come on, don't be shy," the crime boss laughed, gesturing toward the bloodied woman. "Take her for a test drive. Consider it a signing bonus for joining my organization."

The words hung in the air for exactly 2.3 seconds while Kyr4n's enhanced nervous system processed threat assessment, tactical options, and probability matrices. Then his body simply moved.

Three fluid steps carried him across the room with mechanical precision. His right hand found Rico's throat with the same unconscious accuracy his fingers had once found circuit pathways in total darkness. The motion was so smooth, so inevitable, that it seemed less like violence and more like a natural law asserting itself.

Rico's eyes bulged as he was lifted from the bed and slammed against the wall hard enough to crack expensive paneling. His augmented strength meant nothing against virus-enhanced muscle fibers that had automatically calculated the exact pressure needed to maintain control without causing immediately fatal damage.

Kyr4n's left hand had materialized his sidearm without conscious thought, the weapon tracking toward Marcus with the fluid certainty of advanced targeting systems. His expression remained completely neutral, as if he were calibrating a piece of equipment rather than choking a man.

For several heartbeats, the only sounds were Rico's strangled gasps and the subtle whir of Marcus's enhanced reflexes cycling through threat assessment protocols.

"Any objections?" Kyr4n asked conversationally, his voice carrying no more emotion than if he'd been asking about the weather.

Marcus had been reaching for his holster, but his chrome-plated fingers froze as he processed what had just happened. His military-grade reflexes were supposed to give him an edge against baseline humans. Instead, he'd barely registered movement before his boss was being held against the wall like a misbehaving child. Now conflicted between his inaptitude at doing his job and his lack of respect for a scumbag like Vasquez.

"No," Marcus managed, his hands moving slowly away from his weapons. "No objections, sir."

"Good." Kyr4n's grip on Rico's throat adjusted slightly, and the crime boss's face began cycling through interesting color variations. "What's your name?"

"Marcus."

"Marcus." Kyr4n considered this while his enhanced nervous system deployed microscopic injection needles through his fingertips. The nanobots swimming into Rico's bloodstream would ensure compliance within hours—a modified version of his own viral load that created dependency rather than enhancement. "Keep your hands off your weapons, for now, and have a seat. We'll need to discuss operational changes."

Kyr4n release Rico's throath when he went limp, letting the man collapse to the carpet.

But Kyr4n had already shifted his attention to the three women, his expression softening almost imperceptibly as he took in their condition.

"Names?" he asked gently.

"Jenna," whispered the redhead, her voice barely audible.

"Helene," added her companion, whose augmented features couldn't quite disguise malnutrition.

"Jenna. Helene." He committed the information to memory with the same precision he'd once used for technical specifications. "Check on your friend. How bad is she?"

They moved with the careful efficiency of people accustomed to being discreet, gentle hands cataloguing injuries that went well beyond surface trauma. Helene's expression darkened as her assessment revealed the full scope of Rico's entertainment.

"She's bad," Helene said quietly. "I could patch her up but it wont do much, we can't treat her her."

"Ok. Take her to Greenfield Tower no. 5," he said. "Pass by the left alley, find the loading dock, someone will be expecting you." He took a closer look at the girl and added "You have fifteen minutes."

They worked with swift efficiency, wrapping their injured colleague in Rico's expensive bedsheets while avoiding eye contact with anyone. Within minutes, they had her supported between them and were heading for the door.

The office fell silent except for the electromagnetic hum of the building's electricity.

"Where are you sending her?" Marcus asked finally, his voice carefully controlled.

"Underground medical center."

Marcus blinked, processing this against everything he'd been told about their visitor. "You pay for medical care? For working girls?"

"In her condition, she have about 30 minutes left to live, you have a better solution?" Kyr4n replied without emotion while setting himself at Rico's desk, accessing his system.

For serval minutes, Kyr4n studied with the same clinical detachment he'd once reserved for failed circuits. Rico's empire generated approximately 2.3 million annually through protection rackets, contraband distribution, and human trafficking.

It was more elegant than simple termination, though the implications were considerably more disturbing.

"What now, Boss?" Marcus asked, and there was something like relief in his tone. Years of watching Rico's casual cruelty had left marks that augmented reflexes couldn't heal.

Kyr4n moved to the windows, his enhanced vision automatically cataloguing the defensive positions in neighboring buildings. The slum stretched to the horizon, a complex ecosystem of desperation and innovation that operated according to rules most people never bothered to understand.

Twelve buildings. Forty-seven human assets. Thousands of potential customers who would discover tomorrow that protection no longer required a side order of terror.

The virus hummed through his nervous system, nanobots interfacing with the building's security networks and updating access protocols. In the span of thirty seconds, Rico's fortress had become his domain.

"Schedule a meeting with all department heads," he said without turning from the window. "We have operational inefficiencies to address."

Marcus nodded slowly, his augmented features reflecting the artificial light from the slum's neon-soaked streets. "And Rico?"

Kyr4n glanced back at the man slumped against the wall, eyes now glazed with the early stages of viral integration. In a few hours, Rico "The Grip" Vasquez would become the most enthusiastic employee in the organization's history.

"Rico will be assisting with the transition to more sustainable business practices," he replied matter-of-factly. "He's very committed to the new operational philosophy."

As if responding to some internal cue, Rico's head bobbed in an eager nod, his face lighting up with chemically induced enthusiasm.

Marcus suppressed a shudder, recognizing that whatever had just occurred was probably worse than simple murder. But when he thought about Jenna and Gillian carrying their broken friend to safety, when he imagined the dozens of other women who might avoid similar treatment...

"Any specific orders, Boss?"

Kyr4n returned his attention to the window, watching surveillance drones patrol the airspace between buildings. Soon, those territories would require better management as well. The thought arose without emotional content, just another technical problem to be solved.

"Run a full audit of current operations," he said. "I want detailed reports on all revenue streams, asset allocation, and personnel management protocols. We're going to optimize this system."

The words emerged with the same flat precision he'd once used to describe circuit repairs. As if he were debugging a particularly complex piece of software rather than rebuilding a criminal empire.
