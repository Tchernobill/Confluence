Kyr4n stood abruptly from the tactical planning table, his chair scraping against the concrete floor of the underground command center. The holographic displays showing tactical data from Operation StoneBone.

"I'm going to the roof," he announced, his voice carrying that particular tone that meant a decision had crystallized. "I want to make... the call."

Marcus looked up from the ammunition inventory. "The call?"

"One last attempt before we roll that train downhill." Kyr4n was already moving toward the vertical access shaft. "If there's even a remote chance they'll listen to reason..."

"You think they'll listen?" Isa asked, though her tone suggested she already knew the answer.
"Probably not. But I need to know I tried. Besides, maybe it's time they officially meet their new neighbor."

Helene rose immediately, her instincts recognizing the tension in his shoulders. "Mon cœur, you don't have to do this alone."

"Hmmmm..." Kyr4n paused at the door, "I could use some company for this, if you dont mind."

Marcus stood up. "Heck! Someone needs to witness whatever crazy shit you're about to pull."

The climb to the roof felt longer than usual, each step marking another step toward escalation or resolution, war or peace. When they finally emerged onto the organization tower's rooftop, Kyr4n paused at the edge, looking across the dark water toward the Citadel. The corporate fortress sprawled before them like a glittering constellation—beautiful, arrogant, and utterly convinced of its own invincibility.

"I want to see them while I'm talking to them," he said quietly, his gaze fixed on the distant lights. "Face to face, even if it's across the water."

Kyr4n set up a monopod with camera array like a common vlogger. The others arranged themselves in the shadows beside him, close enough to hear but out of the camera's view.

"Here we go," he murmured, fingers dancing across the interface. "Time to crash the party."

## Nordam Tower - Executive Floor 80

Eighty floors above the Citadel's pristine streets, the emergency session of the Nordam Corporation Board of Directors had the atmosphere of a war council. The conference chamber—all polished chrome and atmospheric lighting—buzzed with the nervous energy of people accustomed to controlling everything suddenly facing something they couldn't quite understand.

CEO Harrison Blackwell commanded attention from the head of an oval table that probably cost more than most Shore families saw in a lifetime. The wall-mounted displays showed a real-time tactical overview of the "South Shore situation"—satellite feeds of unusual activity, thermal signatures suggesting coordinated movement, and analysis reports that grew more concerning by the hour.

"The productivity metrics are unacceptable," Blackwell stated, his voice carrying the cold authority of a man who'd built an empire. "Manufacturing output down forty percent and falling. The situation requires immediate resolution."

Board member Sarah Chen leaned forward. "As I mentionned in the last meeting, his isn't random unrest, all data models point to an organised and coordinated strategy progressing with increasingly sophisticated planning. That Slum leader is behing all this!"

Around the table, eleven other board members maintained the careful composure of corporate predators, though tension showed in the way fingers drummed against the table's surface and eyes kept drifting toward the windows that offered a commanding view of their island fortress.

Security Director Walsh leaned forward, his military bearing evident even in the expensive suit. "We know where to find most of them, targeted elimination of resistance leadership and their self-support infrastructure remains our most effective option. Precision orbital strikes with minimal workforce disruption."

"What are the projections?" asked Chief Financial Officer Chen, consulting her tablet. "We need specific numbers for risk assessment."

"Success rate above eighty-five percent," Walsh replied confidently. "Collateral damage projections indicate less than one percent of the population affected. We preserve productive capacity while eliminating command structure and independent resource networks."

Board member Reynolds nodded approvingly. "Clean, surgical, and strategically decisive. We eliminate their ability to organize while maintaining labor availability and most of all, we make a statement they can't ignore."

The holographic conference display chimed with a standard meeting connection request."Sir," Reynolds said, glancing at his screen, "new meeting attendee waiting in the lobby. Kyr4n S. Daemon?! Seriously?"

"What the hell—" Walsh began. "How did he got into this conference? This is a secure corporate meeting."

The temperature in the boardroom seemed to drop several degrees. Board members straightened in their chairs, expressions shifting from corporate fatigue to sharp attention. This was the name that had been haunting their security briefings for eighteen months.

Williams leaned forward. "Sir, if he's managed to penetrate our security networks..."

Reynolds, studying the security readouts, "The system shows him as a legitimate participant with proper board-level access credentials. Everything appears to be in order from a technical standpoint."

"That's impossible," Chief Technology Officer Harrison muttered, professional confusion evident in his voice.

Blackwell's jaw tightened. "That son of a bitch. Let him in."

The camera feed activated, showing a clear view of a man's face framed against the night sky. The image quality was excellent, giving them their first confirmed visual identification of the figure who had become such a persistent problem.

"Jesus Christ," Walsh whispered. "That's actually him. That's actually Kyr4n."

"Good evening, thank you for letting me in." The voice emerged from their speakers with crystal clarity—pleasant, conversational, carrying just a hint of technical precision. "I apologize for dropping in at the last minute. I just heard about this important meeting and felt there was a significant matter that needed to be addressed."

Several board members leaned forward, studying the face that intelligence reports had been trying to capture for months.

Walsh's face darkened. "How did you get into this conference? This is a secure corporate meeting."

"I dialed in through" Kyr4n replied politely without expanding more. "I realize we haven't been properly acquainted, and I thought it was time we address that, I'm Kyr4n, pronounced 'V-ran', I'm your friendly but concern neighbour from across the river."

Blackwell found his corporate voice, though it carried an edge of unreality. "Mr... Daemon, I presume. I'm not certain what you think you're accomplishing with this... stunt."

"I wanted to reach out personally to apologize for the 'loud music' we've been playing lately," Kyr4n continued. "It was inconsiderate of us, good neighbors should be mindful of how their activities affect others. The 'noise' from our side has clearly been impacting your productivity, and I would like to address this matter tonight."

"Is he insane?" Walsh muttered under his breath.

Kyr4n's tone shifted slightly, becoming more serious while maintaining its conversational quality. "I also heard through the neighborhood grapevine that you might be planning some... redecorations in our neighborhood. Something about new poles fixtures for our side of the community? (a clear allusion to the orbital kinetic bombardment rods)"

The euphemism struck home. Several board members straightened in their chairs.

"Now, I appreciate that our lighting situation could use some improvement," Kyr4n continued. "The infrastructure over here is admittedly a bit dated. But I have to say, I'm somewhat concerned that your 'improvement' plans might be a touch... aggressive for a residential neighborhood. Perhaps we could discuss some alternatives?"

The responses came in a mixture of corporate politeness and barely controlled hostility. Chen maintained her professional demeanor, Reynolds seemed genuinely intrigued by the technical achievement, but Walsh was clearly restraining himself from exploding.

Blackwell said, deploying his most authoritative CEO voice, "I'm afraid Nordam Corporation's development initiatives are not subject to community consultation. Our planning processes follow established corporate protocols and is NOT open to discutions from outsiders."

"Ah, that's disappointing to hear," Kyr4n replied, and the hurt in his voice seemed genuine. "I was rather hoping we might find some common ground. Ok. Maybe we could discuss a diferent approach, something more personal that I'd wanted to discuss."

"Oh, for crying out loud," Walsh began, but Blackwell raised a hand for silence.

"What did you have in mind?" the CEO asked, more from curiosity than any real interest in negotiation.

The silence stretched for several heartbeats. When Kyr4n spoke again, his voice carried an unexpected vulnerability that made everyone in the room lean forward despite themselves.

"Mr. Blackwell, I've been thinking about our respective situations, and I've come to realize something rather profound. You're a man who has achieved great success, but success can be lonely. And I... well, I never had a father to share life's joys and challenges with."

On the rooftop, Helene's hand flew to her chest as if she'd been shot. Marcus whispered "Sweet Jesus, he's loosing it!" under his breath. Zara asked him discreetly 'What the actual fuck is happening right now?' while Isa bit her lip hard trying to hold it and not to burst into hysterical laughter.

In the conference room, the silence was so complete that the building's ventilation system seemed deafeningly loud.

"I'm sorry," Blackwell said slowly, his voice carefully controlled. "Are you... what are you talking about?"

"Mr. Blackwell, would you... adopt me?"

"I... what?" Blackwell managed.

"Think about the human connection it could bring to both our lives," Kyr4n said, his voice warming with genuine enthusiasm. "As your son, I would love and respect you, not for your power or your position, but for who you are as a person. And God knows I could use some fatherly guidance right now—I feel like I'm stuck in some kind of rebellious teenage phase, you know? Making poor life choices, acting out against authority figures..." A sound that might have been a suppressed snort came from off-camera.

He paused, and when he continued, there was a note of almost embarrassed confession in his voice. "Perhaps a father's steady hand could help me find more... constructive outlets for my energy."

The board members stared at their screens in absolute bewilderment.

"You're serious," Blackwell said finally, not quite a question.

"Just imagine the possibilities," Kyr4n pressed on. "Father and son, working together to bridge the gap between our communities. We could unite the North Shore and South Shore as one, build something unprecedented—a true partnership between innovation and tradition, between corporate efficiency and grassroots creativity."

He laughed, and the sound carried genuine warmth. "I'd love for you to take me fishing sometime, Mr. Blackwell. We could spend a weekend by the water, just talking and laughing about that time we almost blew each other to pieces. What better foundation for a strong father-son relationship?"

Blackwell's mouth opened and closed without producing sound.

For a moment—just a brief, surreal moment—Blackwell's expression showed something that might have been actual consideration. The sheer audacity of the proposal seemed to short-circuit his corporate conditioning, and there was a flicker in his eyes that suggested he was genuinely processing the idea.

But reality reasserted itself as other board members shifted uncomfortably and Walsh grabbed his shoulder, bringing him back to his corporate protocols and shareholder responsibilities.

"I'm afraid," Blackwell said slowly, his voice carefully formal, "that such an arrangement would be... inappropriate. Corporate governance structures don't accommodate personal relationships of that nature."

"Oh." The disappointment in Kyr4n's voice was palpable. "Well, I suppose I had to ask. Perhaps then we could explore a more traditional business partnership then? Something mutually beneficial?"

"Let me clarify the reality of our situation," Walsh interjected harshly. "The Slum exists to provide labor and resources while the Citadel provides leadership and direction. Under no circumstances does the South Shore dictate terms to corporate management. We're already showing remarkable generosity by maintaining employment and resource allocation. You have no leverage, no assets of value, and no position from which to negotiate. Everything you think you possess—including those three hundred heavy drones you've been so pathetically attempting to conceal—represents nothing more than empty posturing."

Chen nodded agreement. "Three hundred drones would provide perhaps a few minutes of entertainment for our defense AI systems. You have nothing we want or require."








Kyr4n's voice turned quiet and serious. "I need to correct a fundamental misunderstanding. I never engage in empty posturing. Bluffing is what people do when they lack confidence in their actual capabilities but still hope to achieve ambitious outcomes. I prefer more direct approaches."

Walsh was getting annoyed. "You're waisting your time, you have no negociation power, nothing, go back fixing your junk, for what's left of your time"

"While the Citadel defences are the apex, it is not without vulnerability. I visited the Citadel serval times, with next to no documentations or ressources... I've touch with my bare hand the East corner of the very  building you are currently sitting in. I had a tuna sandwish from Clark's, three block North, they do live up to they reputation!"

"I'm asking, as a final attempt at reasonable dialogue, whether there's any possibility of establishing a genuinely balanced partnership between our communities. Some arrangement where both sides contribute their strengths and benefit from the collaboration."

"Absolutely impossible," Walsh stated flatly. "Corporate hierarchy is non-negotiable. The existing structure serves everyone's best interests."

The silence that followed felt different from the previous pauses. It stretched long enough to become uncomfortable, filled with the subtle hum of electronic systems and the distant sound of the Citadel's climate control systems.

"Lost your tongue, terrorist?" Walsh asked with obvious mockery.

"Lost my faith." Kyr4n replied softly after a moment.

His voice carried a profound sadness that seemed to reach through the electronic medium and touch something human in the sterile corporate environment.

"I'm genuinely disappointed. This conversation has reached a point where further dialogue becomes meaningless, and that makes me very sad indeed."

Behind him, invisible to the conference cameras, he made a simple gesture to Marcus—a slight nod, nothing more.

Marcus understood. Operation StoneBone was authorized. With his internal comms, he sent serval messages to the various teams awating they orders. 'StoneBone is a go, charge up, load, and proceed with the assigned engagements list'.

Meanwhile, the board members exchanged glances. Blackwell's hand slammed down on the table. "The role of the South Shore is to produce what we require while we provide leadership and direction. You seem to have a fundamental misunderstanding of your position."

"Our position?" Kyr4n asked quietly.

"You work for us," Director Chen added, her voice sharp with corporate authority. "In no circumstances can the South Shore dictate terms to the Citadel. We're already being generous keeping you employed despite the resources we provide—housing, food distribution, medical care."

"Infrastructure maintenance," Williams added. "Security services. Economic coordination."

"The entire framework that allows your communities to exist," Blackwell concluded. "And you think you can call us up and demand... what? A seat at the table? Equal partnership with your betters?"

Kyr4n was quiet for a long moment. When he spoke again, his voice carried a note of genuine disappointment. "I had hoped we could find a different path."

As he spoke, several board members glanced toward the windows. Outside, across the dark water, lights were beginning to wink out across the South Shore Slum. Sector by sector, entire neighborhoods went dark in a pattern too coordinated to be accidental.

"The path is simple," Blackwell said coldly. "Return to your assigned roles. Cease this organized resistance nonsense. Accept that the current arrangement serves everyone's best interests."

"And if we don't?"

"Then we go ahead redecorate your neighbourhood of yours. Sometimes harsh decisions are necessary for the greater good."

Another long silence stretched across the connection. Finally, Kyr4n nodded slowly.

"I understand," he said. "Thank you for clarifying your position. There won't be any ambiguity about what comes next."

Director Martinez squinted at the display. "Are we seeing power outages over there?"

Williams chuckled. "HA!, did they forget to pay their electricity bill this month?"

Several board members actually smiled at that—the idea of the slum dwellers losing power over unpaid bills seemed to fit their worldview perfectly.

Kyr4n's expression didn't change, but something shifted in his eyes. "Tonight," he said quietly, "the bill is for the Citadel."

He reached toward something off-camera, and his voice carried a tone of polite finality. "Ladies and gentlemen of the Boards, thank you for your time, I wish you a good night."

The connection terminated.

## The Roof

Kyr4n sat back from the communication array, his expression unreadable in the dim light reflected from the Citadel across the water. Behind him, his companions remained silent, processing what they had just witnessed.

"Well," Isa finally said. "That was... thorough."

"Adoption?" Marcus whispered, still sounding stunned. "You actually asked a corporate CEO to adopt you? And... fishing?"

"Had to try," Kyr4n replied quietly. "Had to know if there was any possibility of finding another way. This makes it official, you know. We're at war now. No more pretending it's just... neighborhood disputes."

Alex joined them on the roof, bringing popcorn that make others perplex.

The deep thrumming sounds of massive electrical systems coming online could be felt more than heard, a vibration that seemed to rise from the earth itself. In the distance, the first bright streaks appeared in the night sky as the Citadel's defense grid came fully online, responding to detected threats.

Zara moved to stand beside Kyr4n, watching the lights die across their home while new, deadlier lights began to dance in the sky above. "No regrets?"

He was quiet for a long moment, his face illuminated by the distant glow of laser emitters beginning their deadly dance across the darkness.

"People will die, I hate that. But no," he said finally. "It had to come to this sooner or later. Better on our terms than theirs."

There was a huge resonating woosh and the first projectile was screaming through the night sky.

In the distance, the Crown Defense Grid's interceptor systems woken up by the signature on an incoming projectile, that would soon be followed by more.

The war for the future had begun with weapons from the past.
