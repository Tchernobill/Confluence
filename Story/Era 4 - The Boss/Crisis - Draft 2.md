The cafeteria was quiet at this hour.

Most of the night shift had already cycled through, leaving behind the smell of recycled coffee and whatever protein-heavy slop the kitchen had deemed "stew." Zara pushed the remains of hers around the bowl, not really eating. Across from her, Marcus cradled a cup of tea like it was something precious.

"You actually drink that shit?" she asked.

"Tea is not shit." He took a measured sip. "Tea is civilization in a cup. Keeps you alert without the jitters."

"Tastes like hot leaf water."

"That's literally what it is."

"Exactly my point."

Marcus almost smiled. Almost. "A sergeant in Beijing sector taught me. Twenty years ago. Said coffee was for people who wanted to feel awake. Tea was for people who wanted to actually _be_ awake."

"Sounds like bullshit."

"Probably was." Another sip. "Still switched."

Zara snorted and pushed her bowl away. These moments were rare—the quiet ones, where nothing was actively trying to kill them and the weight of the organization could be set aside for ten minutes. She didn't hate them.

"You ever think about—"

Marcus's communicator beeped.

Not the standard chime. The emergency tone—three sharp pulses that cut through the ambient noise like a knife. His hand was on it before the third pulse finished.

Sedh's voice. Clipped. Terse. "Marcus, please report to Kyr4n's private workshop urgently."

The line cut.

No explanation. No context. Just the message and silence.

Marcus was already moving, chair scraping back across the floor. "Emergency in the boss's private workshop."

Zara was half a step behind him. The stew sat forgotten on the table, slowly cooling.

---

They took the stairs—faster than waiting for the lift, and neither of them mentioned it. Seven floors up. Zara's mind ran through scenarios automatically: attack, medical emergency, security breach. None of them fit. If it was any of those, Sedh would have said. Would have given them something to work with.

The fact that he hadn't told her more than any explanation could.

Sedh was waiting outside the workshop door. That alone confirmed something was wrong. She'd never seen him voluntarily separate himself from Kyr4n during anything important.

"What's up?," Marcus said.

"Kyr4n is inside his workshop, currently implementing structural changes to his framework architecture." Sedh's voice was steady, but something underneath it wasn't. "The changes are significant and are causing considerably more stress than we anticipated."

"Framework?" Zara asked. "The hell does that mean?"

Sedh turned toward her. "It is currently at fifty-five percent and progressing steadily but to the inconveniences experienced, Marcus's presence is require as a precaution but I remain confident we won't need the failsafe protocol."

Marcus went very still beside her. Something passed between him and the AI—a look, a recognition. Zara filed it away.

"Unfortunately," Sedh continued, "under the current circumstances, the workshop cannot be considered a safe environment for myself. I'll assist from here while accessing remotely via the room's comm system."

"Not safe for you?" Zara's eyes narrowed.

"Elevated risk of electromagnetic interference, at sufficient level, they could cause permanent damage to my primary systems." A pause. "Kyr4n insisted I remain outside."

Marcus was already moving toward the door. "Let's get in."

---

The workshop door opened to heat, the air thick and heavy and wrong. Zara could feel it pressing against her skin the moment she crossed the threshold. The smell hit her next: hydraulic oil and something metallic, like blood but not quite.

Kyr4n sat in a reinforced chair at the centre of the room. Restraints at wrists and ankles—not standard cuffs, something heavier, industrial. His eyes were closed, sweat ran down his face in rivulets.

The lights flickered. A low buzzing sound filled the air—not from any visible source. It seemed to come from everywhere. From him.

His eyes opened. Found her.

"No." His voice was quiet. Fractured. Each word dropping separately. "You shouldn't... you can't be here. Please."

"If I shouldn't see this," Zara said, "I definitely want to see it."

"_Oh, wonderful. The attack dog wants to watch you fall apart. How romantic._"

Kyr4n's head twitched. His eyes darted to the left—toward empty space. His jaw tightened further.

"Fifty-seven percent," Sedh's voice announced through the room's speakers. "Integration progressing."

Marcus stepped closer to the chair. "Can this be aborted?"

"Not possible." Sedh's voice. Clinical but strained. "It is failure or success. There is no third option."

"What happens if it fail?" Marcus asked.

Kyr4n's eyes opened fully. Met Marcus's gaze.

"Cabinet," he said. His voice had changed—still quiet, but harder now. More controlled. "Third drawer. There's a vest. I need you to strap it to my back."

Marcus moved without questioning, retrieved something from the cabinet—tactical black, heavy, small black boxes visible along the spine. His face didn't change, but his hand hesitated for just a moment before lifting it.

"I must object," Sedh said through the speakers. "Strongly object. The vest is a last resort measure and should not be—"

"What's the vest for?" Zara cut in.

Silence.

"Sedh," she said. "What. Is. It."

"Remote-controlled shaped charges." The AI's voice had gone flat. Emotionless in the way that meant too much emotion underneath. "Oriented inward along the spine and cervical vertebrae. If used, I would strongly suggest vacating the room first."

A kill switch. She'd known it the moment she saw the design, but hearing it confirmed—

"Sixty percent," Sedh announced. "Vital signs elevated but within parameters."

Marcus held the vest. Looked at it. Looked at Kyr4n. He hesitate.

"We have a deal, Marcus."

The words hung in the air. Heavy. Final.

"What deal?" Zara demanded.

No one answered her.

"_They're ignoring you. How does that feel? Being on the outside? You're not family. You're not even close. You're just the hired muscle who spread her legs and thought it meant something._"

Kyr4n's head snapped to the side again. "Shut up."

"What?," Zara said.

"Not you."

"This is fucked up," Zara muttered, but she made no move to interfere.

Marcus was strapping the vest onto Kyr4n's back now. Careful movements. When he stepped back, he held a small device in his hand—analogue, chunky, deliberately primitive. A remote detonator.

"Sixty-three percent," Sedh said, "We are doing good."

Kyr4n managed something that was almost a smile. "Don't worry. At one hundred percent, cake should be served."

Nobody laughed.

---

The buzzing grew worse.

It wasn't just sound anymore—Zara could feel it in her teeth, in her bones. The metal worktable at the far end of the room had started to vibrate, tools rattling against its surface. The heat continued to climb.

"Sixty-eight percent. Signs of cognitive fragmentation detected." Sedh's voice had lost its clinical distance. "Kyr4n, you need to regulate. Focus on your breathing. Remember what we practiced."

"I'm trying." His voice cracked. "She won't—she keeps—"

"_You can't shut me out. You think this little rewrite of yours is going to change anything? Going to make you BETTER? You'll never be better. You'll never be anything but what you are._"

"Stop."

"_What you've always been. A monster wearing a person suit. And now you're trying to modify the monster? Make it more palatable? More controllable?_"

"I said _stop_."

"Seventy-one percent."

The lights flickered violently. A fluorescent tube exploded overhead, raining glass. Marcus shifted position, putting himself between Zara and the chair. She wanted to shove him aside, tell him she didn't need protection, but something in the air—something wrong and electric and _alive_—kept her still.

"Who's Frank?" Kyr4n asked suddenly.

Zara blinked. "What?"

"Frank. You mentioned Frank." His head turned, eyes unfocused. "You keep bringing up Frank like I should—I don't know anyone named Frank."

"Sir," Marcus said carefully. "No one mentioned—"

"_I didn't say Frank, darling. That's all you. Pulling names out of the static. Your mind's coming apart at the seams and you don't even notice._"

"Seventy-four percent. Kyr4n, please. Focus."

"_Do you remember what you did to get here? The bodies? The blood? The ones who trusted you? Remember Isa? Remember how she looked at you when she finally understood what you really were?_"

Kyr4n went rigid. "Don't."

"_She ran. She ran from you. And you tell yourself you let her go, but we both know the truth. She ran away because she were terrified of what you'd do to her. Terrified you'd—_"

"I GOT RID OF HER!"

"I sent her away," he said, quieter now. Broken. "I made her leave. I chose that. I chose—". The last words died in his throat.

"Seventy-seven percent."

"Who?" Zara asked.

"Who the fuck is she talking about? Who's the woman?"

"_Oh, she doesn't know about your great love? The one you destroyed? The one you're still destroying every day just by existing?_"

"Zara." Marcus's voice. Low. Warning. "Not now."

The buzzing reached a crescendo, then suddenly—stopped.

Silence. Oppressive and complete.

"Eighty-five percent," Sedh announced. "Integration entering final phase. Vital signs... stabilizing?"

Kyr4n's breathing had slowed. His body had relaxed in the chair. When he opened his eyes, they looked almost normal. Almost clear.

"That's better," he said. His voice was steadier. Calmer. "That's... okay. That's okay."

Marcus let out a breath. "Sir?"

"I'm alright. I think the worst is past." He rolled his shoulders, winced. "The restraints. They're cutting into me. Can you—"

"Eighty-seven percent."

"Can you loosen them? Just a little."

Marcus hesitated. His thumb rested on the detonator. "I don't think—"

"_You're scaring them. Good. They should be scared. They should know what you really are._"

"Please. It hurts." Something plaintive in his voice now. Vulnerable. "Marcus, I'm okay. I just need to breathe."

"I must strongly advise against releasing him." Sedh's voice was sharp. Urgent. "The integration is not complete. Cognitive readings are still fluctuating. This could be some—"

"I'm fine." Kyr4n's voice hardened. The shift was sudden—calm to cold in a heartbeat. "I'm telling you I need this. Marcus."

Marcus looked at the detonator. Looked at Kyr4n. Looked at Zara.

Then he stepped back.

"I can't do that. Let's wait a bit more."

"_The soldier knows what you are even if he won't say it. He knows what happens when you're free. When you stop PRETENDING—_"

"THEN DON'T PRETEND!"

Kyr4n's arms ripped free.

Not the restraints breaking—the actual metal chair arms, tearing away from the frame like wet paper. He was on his feet in a movement too fast to track, and the air around him _shimmered_ with heat. The floor cracked beneath him. The walls groaned.

"_YES. Yes! This is what you are! This is what you've always been! Stop fighting it! Stop HIDING—_"

"Stay back!" Kyr4n's voice, but not. Layered. Harmonic. Wrong. "Stay away from me!"

Marcus had the detonator up. His thumb was on the trigger. His face was stone but his eyes—his eyes were wet.

Zara didn't move. Couldn't move. The heat was unbearable now, pressing against her like a physical weight, but something deeper than survival instinct kept her rooted. This wasn't a threat she could fight. This was something else entirely.

"Ninety-one percent," Sedh said. His voice was barely audible over the roar of displaced air. "Ninety-two. Kyr4n—Kyr4n, please. Come back. You're almost there."

The thing that had been Kyr4n turned. Looked at the speaker where Sedh's voice emerged. Something flickered across its face—recognition, maybe. Or memory.

"Sedh?" His voice. Still layered, but quieter now. "Sedh, I can't... I can't see..."

"Ninety-four percent. You're stabilizing. Hold on. Please hold on."

"I don't want to hurt them." A whisper. Desperate. "I don't want to—"

"Ninety-five percent. Ninety-six."

The heat began to fade.

"Ninety-seven. Ninety-eight."

The glow around his skin dimmed.

"Ninety-nine."

Kyr4n fell.

His knees hit the cracked floor. His hands caught him before his face did. He knelt there, head bowed, shoulders heaving with ragged breaths.

"Integration complete," Sedh said. His voice cracked on the words. "Framework modifications successfully integrated. Vital signs returning to baseline."

Nobody moved.

Nobody spoke.

Then Kyr4n laughed—a broken, exhausted sound that was half sob.

"Told you," he whispered. "Cake."

---

They gave him five minutes.

Five minutes of silence while the emergency lights flickered back to full strength, while the heat dissipated into something merely uncomfortable, while the cracked floor stopped radiating whatever energy had shattered it. Five minutes while Kyr4n remained on his knees, head bowed, breathing slowly returning to normal.

Then Marcus spoke.

"What the _fuck_ was that?"

His voice was harder than Zara had ever heard it. The detonator was back in his pocket, but his hands were shaking—both of them, chrome and flesh alike.

Kyr4n raised his head. He looked like death—sheet-white, eyes sunken, lips cracked. But he looked _human_ again. Present.

"Marcus—"

"No." Marcus stepped forward. Fifteen years of military discipline in every line of his body, but something raw underneath. Hurt. Betrayed. "You don't get to 'Marcus' me right now. I've followed you for three years. I've killed for you. I was ready to—" His voice broke. He mastered it. "I was ready to kill _you_. And I don't even know what I almost killed."

Kyr4n closed his eyes.

"You're right."

"Damn right I'm right."

"I know." He opened his eyes. Met Marcus's gaze without flinching. "I understand your concerns. I do. And I apologize—for putting you in that position. For putting both of you in that position."

Zara hadn't spoken. Wasn't sure she could. Her throat felt raw from the heat, but it was more than that. The thing she'd seen—the darkness in him, the wrongness, the power that had bent metal and cracked concrete—

She'd stayed anyway. That scared her more than anything.

"I need a few hours," Kyr4n said. His voice was wrecked. Sandpaper and broken glass. "To recover. To think about how to explain what you just saw."

"I want answers _now_."

"And you'll get them. Both of you." He managed to stand, swaying slightly. "But I need to be able to think. To find the right words. What I have to tell you—it's not simple. And you deserve to hear it clearly."

Marcus's jaw tightened.

"A few hours," Kyr4n repeated. "Then I'll reveal everything. The whole truth about what I am. What was done to me. All of it."

"And if I say no?"

Kyr4n looked at him. Something moved in his eyes—exhaustion, yes, but also something deeper. Respect. Trust.

"Then you say no. And I'll do my best right now. But Marcus—" He took a shaky breath. "I'm done doing this alone. I need you to let me do it right."

A long silence.

"A few hours," Marcus said finally. "Not a second more."

"Understood."

Marcus turned and walked out. His footsteps echoed in the damaged corridor.

Zara stayed.

"You too," Kyr4n said quietly. "You should rest. This was—"

"Who's Isa?"

He went still.

"You said you got rid of her. The... voice. Whatever the fuck that was. It kept bringing her up." She stepped closer. Close enough to see the tremors still running through his hands. "Who is she?"

For a moment, she thought he wouldn't answer.

"Someone I loved," he said finally. "A long time ago. Someone I hurt by loving her."

"She leave you?"

"I made her leave." His eyes were distant. Lost in something she couldn't see. "It was the kindest thing I ever did. The only kind thing."

Zara didn't know what to say to that. So she didn't say anything.

She just stood there, in the ruined workshop, with a man who'd nearly torn himself apart—and somehow, impossibly, that felt like enough.
