Kyr4n stepped aside and she entered, the door sliding shut behind her with a soft pneumatic hiss. His quarters were sparse as always—functional furniture, scattered datapads, the impersonal space of someone who lived for work rather than comfort.

He moved to the small medical kit mounted on the wall, pulling it down. "Sit."

"I'm fine," Zara said, but even to her own ears it sounded weak. The adrenaline was starting to fade, replaced by the dull throb of cuts and bruises. Nothing serious. Nothing she hadn't dealt with a hundred times before.

"Sit," he repeated, his voice carrying an edge she rarely heard. "Please."

She sat on the edge of his couch, watching as he knelt in front of her with the medical kit. His hands were steady, precise, as he opened an antiseptic pack.

_Oh, this is delicious,_ Evilisa's voice purred from somewhere behind him—that ghost presence he'd been fighting all evening. _Look at her. Bloodied and victorious. Coming to you. And you're going to play medic?_

He ignored the hallucination, focusing on Zara's face. The split lip first. He dabbed antiseptic carefully, watching her jaw tighten but her eyes never leaving his.

"You shouldn't have gone alone," he said quietly.

"But I did. And I succeeded." Pride edged her voice. "The datachip has everything we need."

"I don't care about the datachip."

She blinked. "What?"

_Liar,_ Evilisa whispered, closer now. _You care. But you care about HER more. Look at those cuts. Someone hurt what's yours._

"You could have been killed," Kyr4n continued, his thumb moving to clean a cut on her cheekbone. "Dmitriev is FSB-trained. Kozlov's compound has thirty armed guards. If something had gone wrong—"

"It didn't." Zara caught his wrist, her grip firm despite the tremor from fading adrenaline. "I handled it. I got what we needed. This—" She gestured at her face. "—is the cost of doing the job."

"The job is not worth—" He stopped himself, jaw tightening.

_Not worth losing her,_ Evilisa finished, her form materializing in his peripheral vision, all dark curves and predatory grace. _Say it. You know it's true. The intel means nothing if she dies getting it._

Zara's eyes narrowed, studying his face. "What's going on with you?"

"Nothing." He tried to pull back. She didn't release his wrist.

"You're tense. Angry. But not at me." Her enhanced senses caught the subtle tells—elevated heart rate, the way his muscles were coiled tight, the heat of his skin. "What is it?"

_She can see it,_ Evilisa laughed. _Sees right through you. The control slipping. The thing inside you that wants—_

"I'm fine," Kyr4n said, more harshly than intended. "Let me finish treating your injuries."

"No." Zara leaned forward, close enough that their faces were inches apart. "You're not fine. And neither am I. We've been dancing around this for two weeks. Since that conversation. Since the training mat. Since—" She paused, something shifting in her expression. Recognition. "You know exactly what I need." Zara stopped in front of his chair, close enough that he could smell the adrenaline on her skin, feel the heat radiating from her body. "Stop pretending you don't."

_She thinks she knows what you need. Cute._

He set the tablet aside with deliberate precision, finally meeting Zara's eyes. Not the hallucination's electric-gleaming gaze, but the living woman's dark intensity.

"I'm not sure—"

Zara moved. Not the fluid grace of their sparring sessions, but something more primal. Her hand tangled in his shirt, pulling him to his feet with surprising force. Her mouth found his before he could complete whatever rational objection he'd been forming.

The kiss was nothing like careful exploration. She bit his lower lip hard enough to taste copper, her nails digging into his chest through the fabric. When he didn't immediately respond, she pressed closer with deliberate pressure.

_How aggressive. Does she think violence makes her special? That you haven't seen worse?_

"I can feel your pulse," Zara murmured against his mouth, her enhanced hearing picking up the acceleration of his heartbeat. "Stop thinking. Start acting."

Her hands moved to his belt, fingers working with the same efficiency she brought to disarming explosives. No hesitation, no questions, just direct application of force to achieve desired results.

Kyr4n caught her wrists. Not gently.

"What are you asking for—" His voice carried a growing darker tone.

_Don't pretend you don't know exactly what she wants. What you both want._

"I'm not asking." Zara twisted against his grip, testing his strength, finding it exactly as overwhelming as she'd hoped. "I'm taking."

The words hung between them for exactly three heartbeats.

Then something shifted behind Kyr4n's dark eyes—not the careful control he maintained in combat, not the strategic calculation he applied to every interaction. Something rawer. More honest.

_Oh, she's 'taking' now. How bold. Let's see how long that confidence lasts._

His grip on her wrists tightened to the edge of pain. "You're taking?"

"Yes."

_She has no idea what she's asking for. You'll break her, and then she'll run. Just like the others._

He spun her around with enhanced speed, pressing her face-first against the wall beside his desk. One hand pinned both her wrists above her head while his body pressed against her back, the hard length of him unmistakable against her ass.

"And if I take instead?" His voice had dropped to something darker, the careful modulation he maintained for public consumption stripped away.

_Go ahead. Show her what you really are. Watch her realize she made a mistake._

Zara's breathing had quickened, her back arching to press harder against him. "Then we'll see who's stronger."

His free hand moved to her throat, fingers wrapping around her neck with precision that came from virus-enhanced proprioception. Not choking—applying just enough pressure to make breathing interesting, to feel her pulse racing against his palm.

_She trusts you. How long do you think that will last?_

"I'm stronger," he said quietly against her ear. "We both know it."

"Prove it."

_Temporary. They all leave eventually._

He released her wrists only to grip her tactical pants, pulling them down with her underwear in one efficient motion. The sound she made—half surprise, half triumph—sent electricity down his spine.

His hand found her between her legs, finding her wet and ready. The clinical part of his mind noted her body's response—accelerated heartbeat, flushed skin, the way she pressed back against his touch. The rest of him just wanted more.

"All that aggression," he murmured, his fingers moving in a rhythm designed to drive her insane. "All that control. And this is what you really want."

_She wants to feel powerful by surrendering to you. How pathetic. As if she's the first._

She pressed back against him, feeling the hard length of him through his clothes, her hips moving in counterpoint to his hand. "More."

"Ask properly."

_Make her beg. At least make her work for it before she inevitably disappoints you._

"Please." The word came out strangled, her pride warring with need and losing decisively.

"Better." But he didn't give her more—just maintained the same maddening pace while his free hand moved to cup her breast, thumb working over the nipple until she was shaking against the wall.

When he finally entered her, it was with a single hard thrust that drove her forward, palms slapping against concrete for balance. The sound she made was purely animal—no words, just the expression of a hunger finally being fed.

_So primal. She thinks this makes her special to you._

He set a brutal pace, one hand gripping her hip hard enough to bruise, the other still tangled in her hair. Each thrust pressed her against the rough wall, the friction adding another layer of sensation that rode the line between pleasure and pain.

"This what you wanted?" His voice was steady despite the physical exertion, that inhuman control asserting itself even now. "To be held down? Used?"

_She'll regret this. They always do. Then she'll leave, and it'll just be us again._

She couldn't form words, could only push back against him, taking everything he gave and demanding more with the arch of her spine, the desperate sounds escaping her throat.

When his hand moved between her legs again, finding the sensitive bundle of nerves and working it with precise pressure, she came with a cry that was part triumph, part surrender. Her whole body convulsed around him, muscles clenching with the kind of intensity that would have injured a normal man.

But Kyr4n wasn't normal. He rode out her climax without pause, then pulled out and turned her around, lifting her as if she weighed nothing and pinning her back against the wall. This time she could see his face—the cold focus in his dark eyes, the absolute certainty of someone who knew exactly what he was doing.

_Look at her watching you like you're something special. She doesn't understand what you are._

When he entered her again, her legs wrapped around his waist automatically, heels digging into his lower back to pull him deeper. The new angle let her watch his expression, see the moment when his careful control finally cracked.

"More," she demanded against his mouth, the word barely recognizable.

_She thinks she can demand things from you. How long before she realizes she's nothing?_

His response was to shift his grip, one hand supporting her weight while the other moved between them. She felt him withdraw completely, then the blunt pressure against a different entrance—one that made her eyes widen with sudden understanding.

"Kyr4n—" Her protest died as he pressed forward slowly, inexorably, watching her face with predatory focus.

_Using her body like a toy. Is this supposed to mean something?_

The initial stretch made her breath hitch, fingers digging into his shoulders as her body adjusted to the unfamiliar invasion. For a moment her usual confidence flickered, replaced by something more vulnerable.

"Breathe," he said, his voice dropping to something gentler despite the position, despite the way he held her pinned. "I've got you."

_How tender. As if comfort means anything coming from you._

She did breathe, forcing her muscles to relax, and felt him sink deeper. The sensation was overwhelming—fuller than anything she'd experienced, the edge of too much that somehow transformed into exactly what she needed.

"Fuck," she hissed when he finally bottomed out inside her. "Don't you dare hold back now."

_Trying to prove she can handle you. They all try._

His smile was sharp-edged and dangerous. "Wouldn't dream of it."

When he started moving, it was with the same brutal efficiency he brought to combat—precise, powerful, overwhelming. His enhanced strength let him support her weight with one arm while the other hand worked between her legs, adding another layer of sensation that made her cry out.

She bit his shoulder hard enough to leave marks, nails raking down his back, and he growled in response—a sound that had nothing to do with pain and everything to do with the satisfaction of finally letting go.

_Look at you, pretending this matters. It's just biology. Just friction and neurochemicals._

When he came, it was with a loss of control that would have terrified him in any other context—his fingers digging into her flesh, head thrown back, a sound escaping his throat that was more animal than human. For those few seconds, the enhancements weren't tools to be carefully managed but something that took over completely.

They stayed pressed against the wall for several long moments afterward, both breathing hard, sweat-slicked skin cooling in the recycled air. When he finally lowered her to her feet, Zara's legs were unsteady enough that she had to lean against the wall for balance.

_Look at her. Already weak. Already needing support._

His eyes tracked the damage he'd done with automatic assessment—bruises forming on her hips where his fingers had dug in, marks on her wrists, the way she moved with careful stiffness. Something shifted in his expression.

"I'm—"

Her hand slapped over his mouth before he could finish the apology, her palm warm against his lips.

"Shhh." Her eyes held a warning that was half-amused, half-serious. "Don't ruin this for me."

He raised an eyebrow over her hand.

_She thinks she understands you. Give it time._

"I asked for this. I wanted this. These—" She gestured at the darkening marks with her free hand, "—are exactly what I needed." Her thumb brushed across his lower lip as she pulled her hand away. "Start apologizing and I'll have to hurt you properly."

The threat was delivered with the same matter-of-fact tone she used to discuss weapons maintenance, but there was genuine warning beneath it.

"Understood," he said quietly.

"Good." She touched one of the bruises on her wrist experimentally, pressing into the tender flesh with something like satisfaction.

"You'll feel that tomorrow," he observed, already reaching for his discarded clothes.

"Good."

_She wants to wear your marks. How possessive. As if bruises mean anything._

As she gathered her scattered clothes, Kyr4n returned to his chair and picked up the tactical reports, but the words blurred on the screen. The careful boundaries he maintained within himself, between protection and control—had just shifted in ways he wasn't sure he understood.

_You let her in. After everything, you let another one in._

She dressed efficiently and headed for the door. At the threshold, she looked back once.

"Kyr4n?"

"Yes?"

"This doesn't change anything. Professionally."

"No," he agreed, though they both knew it changed everything.

The door closed behind her with a soft click, leaving him alone with the scent of her skin and the uncomfortable realization that she'd found exactly the right way to reach the parts of himself he tried to keep contained.

_Finally. Just us again. Like it should be._

He looked up at the phantom figure who'd been watching the entire encounter from the shadows—Evilisa, with her electric-gleaming eyes and that smile sharp enough to cut.

_She thinks she knows you. She thinks those bruises mean something. But we both know the truth, don't we?_

"Do we," he said quietly to the empty room. Not a question.

_She'll leave. They always leave. Marcus will die eventually. Sedh will move on. But me?_ Her smile widened, cruel and possessive. _I'm the only constant you have. The only one who stays no matter what you become._

He should probably establish boundaries. Make it clear this was a one-time occurrence.

_You won't though. You'll keep taking what she offers until she realizes what you are. Until she sees past the careful control to the monster underneath. And when she runs—and she will run—I'll still be here._

He probably would.

Eventually.

_Keep telling yourself that. Keep pretending she's different. Keep pretending any of them could ever understand you the way I do._ Her voice dropped to an intimate whisper. _In the end, it's always just us. You know that. You've always known that._

The hallucination's presence was almost solid now, feeding on his isolation, his guilt, his fear that she might be right. She moved closer, and he could almost feel the ghost-touch of her hand against his cheek.

_You're mine, Kyr4n. No matter how many others you let touch you. You'll always be mine._

The phantom faded slowly, reluctantly, leaving him alone with tactical reports he couldn't focus on and the uncomfortable certainty that some part of him had enjoyed hearing her claim him.
