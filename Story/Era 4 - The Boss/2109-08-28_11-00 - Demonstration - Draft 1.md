The organisation compound's training room smelled of sweat and synthetic rubber, the kind of honest work-smell that reminded Marcus of better days in legitimate military facilities. He circled Alex on the practice mats, watching the younger man's footwork with the critical eye of someone who'd spent two decades teaching combat to soldiers.

"Elbows in," Marcus corrected, then demonstrated with a quick jab that stopped inches from Alex's guard. "You're telegraphing."

Alex adjusted, nodded, reset his stance. They'd been at this for twenty minutes—not full sparring, just drilling fundamentals that Alex needed to keep sharp. The kid was brilliant with tactics and logistics, but hand-to-hand required constant practice or the muscle memory degraded.

Zara sat on the bench against the far wall, one leg crossed over the other, ostensibly reviewing something on her tablet but Marcus knew her well enough to recognize when she was just present. Watching. Processing. She'd been quieter than usual the past few days, that sharp edge she usually carried slightly muted.

The door hissed open and Kyr4n stepped through, dark hair still damp from a recent shower, wearing his usual work clothes rather than training gear. His eyes scanned the room with that habitual wariness before settling on Marcus.

"Got a minute?" Kyr4n asked.

Before Marcus could respond, Alex straightened from his stance, breathing slightly elevated from the drilling. "Actually, perfect timing." He grabbed a towel, wiping sweat from his face. "You know how you told us we were always welcome to ask questions? About operations, capabilities, how things work?"

Kyr4n's expression remained neutral, but Marcus caught the microscopic tension in his shoulders. "I remember."

Marcus didn't like where this was going. He knew that tone in Alex's voice—analytical curiosity about to become direct interrogation.

"Good." Alex crossed to the wall-mounted display, fingers dancing across the interface until security footage appeared on screen. "Because I've been reviewing operational data from three weeks ago. The Behemoth incident."

The footage showed grainy night-vision green—a warehouse district, Kyr4n facing down a man who looked like he'd been built from spare tank parts. Behemoth. Two meters tall, easily 140 kilos of augmented muscle and subdermal armor plating. Corporate-grade combat modifications that cost more than most people in the Slum earned in a decade.

Marcus watched Kyr4n's face carefully as the footage played. Watched him go very still as his recorded self moved with impossible speed, struck with devastating precision, and dropped Behemoth in under thirty seconds.

"That," Alex said, freezing the frame on Kyr4n standing over the fallen enforcer, "should be impossible. Behemoth outweighs you by what, seventy kilos? Full military-grade augmentation package including reaction-time enhancement, reinforced skeletal structure, synthetic muscle grafts. And you put him down like he was baseline."

The training room had gone very quiet. Even the ventilation seemed to hold its breath.

Kyr4n's jaw worked silently. His fingers flexed at his sides—that nervous tell Marcus had learned meant he was calculating, weighing options, deciding how much truth to reveal.

"I got lucky," Kyr4n said finally. "Hit the right pressure points at the right time."

"Bullshit." Alex's tone remained conversational, but there was steel underneath. "I've analyzed the few engagements where you've actually been in the field. The pattern is consistent—when you do fight, you defeat opponents who should, by every measurable standard, wipe the floor with you." He paused, then added more gently, "Look, it's obvious you're augmented. Despite what you register on scanners—baseline human, no modifications, clean genetic markers. But the performance data doesn't lie."

Marcus saw Kyr4n's throat work as he swallowed. The younger man glanced toward the exit, that familiar calculation of whether this conversation was worth staying for.

"We'd operate better if we knew more," Alex continued. "Not trying to pry into your privacy. Just—tactical understanding. You avoid field work whenever possible, but when you do go out, when we're putting people in the field alongside you—we need to understand what we're actually working with."

"He's right," Marcus said quietly. He'd been content to let Kyr4n keep his secrets, especially since he stayed out of field work most of the time. But Alex had a point. When Kyr4n did engage—those rare, critical moments—the gap between what they observed and what they understood was dangerous. "Not asking for your life story. Just want to understand capabilities for when it matters."

Kyr4n's gaze shifted to Zara, who'd set down her tablet and was watching the exchange with an unreadable expression. For a moment, Marcus thought he saw something pass between them—some silent communication he couldn't quite parse.

"I'm curious too," Zara admitted, her voice carrying that dry edge she used when trying to sound casual about something that mattered. "You've been holding out on us, boss."

The corner of Kyr4n's mouth twitched—not quite a smile, but close. He exhaled slowly, and Marcus watched some internal resistance crumble.

"It's complicated," Kyr4n said finally. "Requires understanding of electromagnetic field manipulation, bioelectric current modulation, cellular-level changes that—"

"Not technical," Marcus interrupted, holding up a hand. "You forget, I'm just a grunt. Prefer practical demonstration over theoretical explanation."

"You want me to—" Kyr4n stopped, glanced around the training room as if seeing it differently. "You want a demonstration."

"Light one," Alex clarified quickly. "Not asking you to break anything expensive. Just want to see what you actually do when you fight."

Marcus noticed Zara sit up straighter on the bench, her attention suddenly laser-focused. There was something in her posture—a protective alertness that seemed disproportionate to the request.

Kyr4n was quiet for a long moment, that internal calculation still running. Then he nodded slowly. "Alright. But controlled. Very controlled. And if I say we stop, we stop immediately."

"Agreed," Marcus said.

Zara stood from the bench, rolling her shoulders with practiced ease. "I'll spar with you." Her tone was professional, matter-of-fact, but as she crossed to the mat, she caught Kyr4n's eye and gave him the briefest wink—quick enough that Marcus almost missed it. A private signal that said something he couldn't quite read. Support, maybe. Or reassurance.

Kyr4n's tension eased fractionally at the gesture. "You sure? This might be uncomfortable."

"I can take uncomfortable." Zara stepped onto the mat, shrugging out of her jacket. Underneath, the sleeveless shirt revealed arms corded with lean muscle and scattered scars. "Besides, better me than Alex. He'd probably want to take notes mid-demonstration."

"I resent that," Alex muttered, but he was grinning as he joined Marcus at the edge of the mat. "Also, I absolutely would take notes."

They squared up on the mat, and Marcus noted the careful distance they maintained—professional spacing, nothing that suggested the intimacy of real partners. Zara moved like water, all flowing readiness and coiled potential. Kyr4n stood looser, almost casual, but there was something in the way he held himself now. Like he was listening to frequencies no one else could hear.

"No full contact," Kyr4n said. "I'm going to demonstrate on blocks and near-misses. Pay attention to what you feel, not just what you see."

Zara nodded, settling into a ready stance. "Show me."

She opened with a testing jab, quick and controlled. Kyr4n slipped it easily, his counterstrike stopping inches from her ribs—a palm strike that looked straightforward until Marcus noticed the air around Kyr4n's hand shimmer, heat-distortion waves rippling outward like summer asphalt.

"Feel that?" Kyr4n asked.

Zara's eyes widened slightly. "Heat. Significant heat. Like standing too close to an open flame."

"Localized microwave emission," Kyr4n explained, pulling his hand back. "Concentrated electromagnetic radiation at frequencies that excite water molecules. Against an actual target, it causes immediate tissue heating. Non-lethal in brief pulses, but extremely painful. Most opponents' instinct is to pull back from the source."

"Jesus Christ," Alex breathed from the sideline. "You're a walking microwave oven."

"Very localized and controlled," Kyr4n corrected, but there was a ghost of dark humor in his voice. "I can't cook a burrito from across the room, if that's what you're worried about."

Marcus filed away the deflection—the joke meant to lighten the reality of what they were seeing. The reality that their leader could burn people from the inside with a touch.

"And the other thing?" Zara asked, resetting her stance. "What you used on Behemoth to short out his implants?"

Kyr4n's expression grew more serious. "Different mechanism. Similar principle. Come at me again, but harder this time. Expect a shock. Brace for it."

Zara threw a more committed combination—jab, cross, hook. Kyr4n wove through the first two with that impossible fluidity, then caught the hook on his forearm and countered with a straight punch that stopped a hair's breadth from her sternum.

The crack of electricity was audible—a sharp pop like static discharge magnified a hundredfold. Blue-white light arced between Kyr4n's knuckles and Zara's shirt, and even from five meters away, Marcus smelled ozone cutting through the recycled air.

Zara's muscles locked for a fraction of a second, her breath catching. Then Kyr4n stepped back and the effect released. She stumbled slightly, catching herself with the grace of long practice, but Marcus saw the tremor in her hands.

"Fuck," she said succinctly, shaking out her arms. "That's what you hit them with?"

"A much milder version," Kyr4n confirmed. He was breathing harder now, and Marcus noticed the sheen of sweat on his forehead—whatever he was doing, it cost him something. "Full discharge can override neural implants, disrupt bioelectric signals, cause involuntary muscle contractions. Against an augmented opponent, it's often enough to create an opening. Against a baseline human..." He trailed off, but the implication hung heavy.

"Carefully controlled, it's a taser effect," Marcus finished, understanding. "Uncontrolled, it's lethal."

Kyr4n nodded once, sharp and final.

Alex was staring at Kyr4n like he'd just witnessed a magic trick, that worshipful intensity Marcus both understood and worried about. "How long have you been able to do this?"

"Years," Kyr4n said quietly. "I've had these abilities for years. It's taken a long time to learn control."

The confession settled between them—the admission that there had been a learning curve, that control had to be learned through practice and probably mistakes. Marcus filed that away with all the other pieces of the puzzle.

"Can you teach it?" Alex asked immediately.

"No." The word was flat, absolute. "It's not a technique. It's a function of how my body processes electromagnetic fields. Something changed at a cellular level. You can't learn this any more than you can learn to be taller."

Zara was still flexing her hands, working sensation back into fingers that had briefly locked up. Marcus watched Kyr4n track the movement with barely concealed concern—he'd rather walk away from this conversation than risk actually hurting one of them.

"Thank you," Zara said quietly, meeting his eyes. "For trusting us with this."

Something eased in Kyr4n's posture at those words. He opened his mouth to respond, but Alex interrupted, his voice carrying that dangerous edge of scientific curiosity fully engaged.

"So that was controlled," Alex said slowly. He gestured toward the corner of the training room where a combat dummy stood on its charging platform—one of the newer automated models with adaptive programming. "What about full intensity? No holding back?"

Kyr4n's expression shuttered immediately. "That's not necessary."

"Maybe it is, though." Alex crossed to the dummy's control panel, already pulling up settings. "Look, what you just showed us—that's the carefully measured version. The version where you're worried about hurting Zara. But the Behemoth footage—that's different. You avoid going out there, but when you do, when someone like Behemoth forces your hand and there's no room for restraint—" He turned back, meeting Kyr4n's eyes steadily. "We need to understand that gap. For those rare times when you have no choice but to be in the field."

"Alex—" Marcus started, recognizing the dangerous line they were walking.

"He's right," Zara said, surprising him. She'd moved off the mat, giving space, but her eyes were sharp on Kyr4n. "You stay off the front lines for a reason. We get that. But there's a difference between what you just showed us and what happens when you're pushed into a corner. We felt a fraction of it. We need to see the whole picture—to understand why you avoid it."

Kyr4n was silent, that internal war playing out behind his carefully controlled expression. Marcus watched him glance at the dummy, then at the observation barrier, then back to the three of them. Calculating. Weighing risks.

"It's not pretty," Kyr4n said finally. "And I'll need all of you behind the barrier. The effects can spread."

"The dummy's built for punishment," Alex said, fingers already dancing across the interface. "Ballistic gel over titanium frame, full sensor array, adaptive combat protocols with automatic progression. It'll start at Level 1 and scale up based on your performance—goes all the way to Level 12 if you're good enough. Also—" He gestured to the wall-mounted display that was flickering to life. "Real-time stats. Current level, strike count, evasion metrics, and energy transfer measured in kilojoules."

Marcus looked at the display. It showed a wireframe representation of the dummy, various readouts at zero, waiting for engagement. Something about seeing it quantified like that—energy measured in precise units, damage calculated and displayed—made this feel more real and somehow more dangerous.

Kyr4n stared at the dummy for a long moment. Then something shifted in his expression—a darkness that flickered across his features before settling into something eerily calm. "You'll stay behind the barrier. All of you. And you don't interrupt, no matter what you see."

"Agreed," Marcus said firmly. He gestured Zara and Alex toward the observation area, putting the reinforced plexiglass between them and the training mat.

The dummy powered up with a mechanical whir, servos engaging as it stepped off its platform. Its optical sensors glowed amber, tracking algorithms engaging. The thing moved with unnatural fluidity—thick leather outer skin stretched over subdermal armor plating, ballistic gel "flesh" beneath that rippling over a steel skeletal frame. It was about Kyr4n's height but broader, built to simulate a heavily augmented fighter with military-grade protection.

The wall display updated: **LEVEL 1 - STANDBY**

Kyr4n moved to the center of the mat. He rolled his shoulders—first the right, then the left, slow and deliberate like he was working out kinks in the joints. Then he shook out his arms, one at a time, loose and easy. His head tilted side to side, vertebrae cracking audibly in the quiet training room.

Marcus felt the hair on the back of his neck stand up.

It wasn't anything overt. Kyr4n's expression remained calm, almost neutral. But the quality of his stillness had changed. The careful control, the measured distance he usually maintained—all of it was dissolving like morning mist under hard sunlight. What replaced it was something Marcus recognized from two decades in combat zones: a predator settling into its true nature.

The stance Marcus had taught him—the disciplined military form, the precise weight distribution—it melted away completely. What emerged was rawer. More primal. Kyr4n's weight settled low and loose, shoulders dropping, fingers spreading slightly at his sides. He looked like he was about to either dance or commit murder, and Marcus honestly couldn't tell which.

"Jesus," Zara breathed beside him, and when Marcus glanced at her, he saw recognition in her eyes. She'd seen this before. Whatever this was, she knew it.

The dummy initiated combat protocols. **LEVEL 1** flashed on the display as it moved forward with basic combination strikes—competent but predictable, the kind of attack pattern a trained baseline human might use.

Kyr4n wasn't there.

He'd shifted his weight in a movement so fluid it seemed to happen between heartbeats, and his palm caught the dummy's extended arm. The air around the contact point shimmered—heat distortion amplified beyond what they'd seen with Zara. The ballistic gel began to smoke immediately.

**STRIKE 1 - 2.3 kJ**

The dummy adapted, pulling back, combat protocols evolving. **LEVEL 2** appeared on screen as its movements grew faster, more complex. It came in with a combination that would have overwhelmed most fighters.

Kyr4n flowed around it like water around stones, and his counter-strike—a punch to the dummy's torso—connected with a crack of electricity that made Marcus flinch.

**STRIKE 2 - 8.7 kJ**

Blue-white lightning arced across the dummy's surface in branching patterns. Its servos stuttered, fibro-muscles twitching spasmodically from the electrical discharge, backup systems engaging, but Kyr4n was already moving. There was no wasted motion, no excess flourish. Every strike was surgical in its precision and devastating in its effect.

**LEVEL 3**

Palm to the shoulder joint—heat bloom so intense the leather skin began to char and crack, subdermal armor plating glowing dull red, exposing scorched ballistic gel and steel beneath.

**STRIKE 3 - 15.4 kJ**

**LEVEL 4**

Elbow to the chest cavity—another electric discharge that made the dummy's optical sensors flicker.

**STRIKE 4 - 23.1 kJ**

Marcus realized he was holding his breath. Beside him, Alex had gone utterly still, eyes locked on the display as the numbers climbed. Zara's hands were pressed flat against the plexiglass barrier.

**LEVEL 5**

The dummy was moving faster now, combat protocols fully engaged, attacking with the speed and power of a heavily augmented fighter. It should have been overwhelming. It should have been impossible for a baseline human to track, let alone counter.

Kyr4n dismantled it methodically.

Knee to the hip actuator—metal screaming as it warped under forces that shouldn't be possible from a human body.

**STRIKE 5 - 34.6 kJ**

**LEVEL 6**

He was breathing harder now, that preternatural calm still holding but edged with something sharper. More intense. The careful control hadn't shattered—it had transformed into something else entirely. Focused violence channeled with terrifying precision.

**STRIKE 6 - 47.2 kJ**

**LEVEL 7**

The display showed the dummy attempting advanced combat patterns now—the kind of augmented-fighter combinations that came with corporate-grade military training. Marcus had seen patterns like this kill trained soldiers.

Something changed.

Kyr4n stopped moving away from attacks. The evasive flow that had defined the first half of the fight vanished. Now when the dummy threw a punch, Kyr4n met it head-on—fist to fist, force against force. But his strikes landed harder, faster, the impact sending visible shockwaves up the dummy's arm. Fibro-muscles seized and tore. Armor plating cracked.

The dummy threw a right cross. Kyr4n's fist intercepted it mid-flight with a crack like a rifle shot. The dummy's hand crumpled, fingers bending at wrong angles, servo assemblies shattering.

**STRIKE 7 - 67.8 kJ**

"Jesus Christ," Alex breathed. "He's not defending anymore. He's just—"

"Overpowering it," Zara finished, her voice tight. "Every attack. Meeting force with superior force."

**LEVEL 8**

Kyr4n caught a strike that should have been too fast to see, his hand closing around the dummy's wrist. The electrical hum rose to a pitch that made Marcus's teeth ache. The dummy's internal systems sparked and failed in cascading sequence.

**STRIKE 7 - 67.8 kJ**

**LEVEL 8**

The synthetic flesh on the dummy's arm was bubbling now, melting away like wax near flame. Kyr4n twisted, using the dummy's compromised structure against it, and delivered a palm strike to its torso that sent visible ripples through the ballistic gel.

**STRIKE 8 - 89.4 kJ**

"That's the energy of a motorcycle crash," Alex whispered, his voice tight with awe and something closer to fear. "He just delivered a motorcycle crash with his hand."

**LEVEL 9**

The dummy was breaking down now, systems failing, but its combat protocols drove it forward with mechanical determination. It moved with desperate speed—the kind of last-ditch assault that came from knowing you were losing.

Kyr4n met it head-on.

**STRIKE 9 - 115.7 kJ**

The dummy's chest plate caved inward. Internal components sparked and shorted. But it kept coming, because it was a machine and machines don't know when to quit.

**LEVEL 10**

Marcus watched Kyr4n's hand close around the dummy's head. For a moment, everything went still—that eerie calm before something breaks. Then the air itself seemed to vibrate, electromagnetic force building to critical density.

The dummy's sensors exploded in showers of sparks. The ballistic gel face began to run like heated wax.

**STRIKE 10 - 158.3 kJ**

**LEVEL 11**

The dummy threw a desperate combination—everything it had left. Kyr4n walked through it like it didn't exist, each incoming strike met and negated by opposing force that shattered servos and crushed actuators.

Then he kicked.

His foot connected with the dummy's head in a roundhouse that came with the full weight of electromagnetic force behind it. The neck assembly—leather, armor plating, ballistic gel, steel vertebrae, all of it—sheared completely. The head sailed across the training room, trailing sparking cables, and slammed into the far wall hard enough to crater the reinforced polymer.

The wall display flickered, error messages cascading across the screen as it lost connection with the dummy's sensor array. Then it went dark completely, voided, unable to track a target that no longer had a head.

**STRIKE 11 - 267.4 kJ** **[SIGNAL LOST - TARGET INTEGRITY COMPROMISED]** **[DISPLAY OFFLINE]**

The dummy's body remained standing for a moment, backup systems trying to compensate, to understand why all sensory input had gone dark. It swayed, servos grinding, fibro-muscles twitching spasmodically.

Kyr4n didn't stop.

He moved in close, and his hands became a blur—a flurry of punches hammering into the dummy's torso, each strike connecting with that same devastating electromagnetic force. The leather skin charred and burned away. Armor plating buckled and split. Ballistic gel boiled and ran. And beneath it all, the steel frame began to glow—first dull red, then cherry red, then orange-hot where his fists made contact.

The impacts rang out like hammer strikes on an anvil—rapid, rhythmic, relentless. Steam and smoke rose from the contact points. The smell of burning leather and synthetic materials filled the training room. The dummy's internal systems sparked and died, but Kyr4n kept hitting it, kept driving electromagnetic force into the collapsing frame until sections of the steel skeleton were glowing bright enough to hurt to look at directly.

Then he stopped.

The dummy collapsed—what was left of it. The torso folded in on itself, the legs gave out, and the whole thing crumpled to the mat in a heap of scorched leather, melted gel, shattered armor, and red-hot steel. Parts of the frame still glowed, heat radiating off the wreckage in visible waves.

The training room fell silent except for the crackle of cooling metal and the ventilation system struggling desperately to clear the smoke and ozone. The wall display remained dark, voided, unable to calculate damage that exceeded all programmed parameters.

Marcus realized he couldn't feel his hands. He was gripping the observation barrier so hard his fingers had gone numb.

Beside him, Alex had stopped breathing. Zara had one hand pressed flat against the plexiglass, her eyes wide.

On the mat, surrounded by the glowing wreckage, Kyr4n turned to face them.

He stood perfectly still for a moment, chest heaving, sweat soaking his shirt. His face held an expression Marcus had never seen before—something dark and satisfied and almost frightening in its intensity. Something primal that had been allowed to surface and didn't want to go back down.

Then, slowly, that darkness faded. The predatory stillness dissolved. Something almost like awareness returned to his eyes—the realization of what he'd just done, what they'd just witnessed.

Kyr4n took a step toward them. Then another. His legs wavered.

He dropped to his knees, catching himself with his hands against the mat. His head bowed, dark hair falling forward to hide his face. His breathing was ragged, harsh, each breath sounding like it was being pulled from somewhere deep.

"Now—" he said, and his voice came out rough, almost conversational despite the circumstances. There was something in his tone Marcus couldn't quite place. Relief, maybe. Or satisfaction. "—that was fun."

The words hung in the air like a confession.

It was subtle—barely a shift in his stance after those words—but Marcus had been watching for the collapse. Kyr4n swayed.

It was subtle—barely a shift in his stance—but Marcus had been watching for it. The transformation reversed in an instant. That predatory presence, that focused violence, all of it dissolved like a switch had been flipped. Kyr4n's shoulders came back up, his breathing turned ragged, and when he turned toward them his face was sheet-white, sweat soaking his hair and running down his temples.

"I need—" he started, then stopped, visibly gathering himself. His voice came out rough, strained. "I need food. A lot of it. Now."

Marcus was already moving, combat medic training overriding the shock of what he'd just witnessed. He hit the release on the barrier and crossed to Kyr4n in three strides, catching his arm as the younger man's knees started to buckle.

"Easy," Marcus murmured, taking most of Kyr4n's weight with practiced ease. Up close, he could feel the tremor running through Kyr4n's frame, could see the way his pupils had dilated, the shocky paleness of his skin. "Alex, protein bars from my locker. Zara, water. Move."

They moved.

Marcus guided Kyr4n to the bench, lowering him carefully. The younger man was shaking now, fine tremors that spoke of complete energy depletion. His breathing came in short, controlled bursts—someone trying very hard not to hyperventilate.

"Metabolic cost," Marcus said, understanding clicking into place with terrible clarity. "Using those abilities burns through energy reserves."

"Calories," Kyr4n managed, the word coming out rough and desperate. "Burns through them like—like running a marathon in thirty seconds. The electromagnetic generation, the precise control, the heat production—it all requires energy. Massive amounts."

Alex skidded back into the room, arms full of protein bars and energy gel packets from Marcus's emergency stash. He dumped them on the bench beside Kyr4n with slightly frantic energy.

Kyr4n grabbed the first protein bar, tearing into it with none of his usual measured control. He ate mechanically, desperately, and Marcus recognized battlefield hunger when he saw it—the body demanding fuel after extreme expenditure, survival instinct overriding everything else.

Zara appeared with water bottles, her movements efficient but her eyes sharp with concern. She cracked one open and pressed it into Kyr4n's free hand, her fingers lingering on his wrist for a moment—checking his pulse, Marcus realized. Smart.

"Heart rate's elevated but steady," she said quietly, meeting Marcus's eyes. "No arrhythmia I can feel. Just exhaustion."

Kyr4n nodded, swallowing hard. "It's just energy debt. I'll be fine in twenty minutes if I can eat enough." He demolished the first protein bar and immediately grabbed another, tearing into it with the same desperate efficiency.

Marcus watched him consume three bars in rapid succession before his hands stopped shaking quite so badly. Color was starting to return to his face, that dangerous pallor fading to something closer to normal post-exercise flush.

Kyr4n took a long pull from the water bottle, then glanced over his shoulder at the wreckage on the mat—the glowing steel frame, the charred leather, the melted components scattered across the training floor.

"Jin's gonna kill me," he muttered, almost to himself.

On the mat behind them, the combat dummy's remains continued to smoke fitfully, sections of steel still radiating heat in visible waves. Marcus tried to conceptualize the level of force required to heat steel to glowing—and failed.

"So that's why you always eat like you're starving on the rare occasions you do fight," Alex said, piecing it together with that analytical mind that never stopped working. "The enhanced abilities require massive caloric intake to sustain."

"During and after," Kyr4n confirmed between bites of his fourth protein bar. "I can operate normally on a standard diet, but any significant use of the electromagnetic abilities—especially at full intensity—depletes reserves catastrophically fast. I've learned to carry emergency rations."

"How often can you do that?" Zara gestured at the demolished dummy, her tone clinical despite the underlying concern. "Full intensity like we just saw?"

Kyr4n paused, clearly running calculations even as he tore into an energy gel pack. "Once, maybe twice a day if I eat enough afterward. More than that and I risk actual physiological damage. The energy has to come from somewhere, and if I push too far without sufficient caloric intake—" He didn't finish the sentence, but the implication was clear enough.

"Your body starts breaking down muscle tissue for fuel," Alex finished, his voice quiet with horrified understanding.

"Among other things." Kyr4n's tone was matter-of-fact, but Marcus heard years of careful survival in those words. Years of learning limits through experience that must have been brutal.

Marcus handed Kyr4n another protein bar and watched him tear into it. The implications were stacking up like cordwood—deadly capabilities balanced by serious limitations, incredible power that came with a metabolic cost that could kill him if he pushed too far.

"This is why you're always carrying those energy bars," Marcus said. "Why your office always has emergency rations stashed. You're not paranoid about food security—you're managing fuel requirements."

"Both things can be true," Kyr4n said, but there was a ghost of humor in his voice now that the immediate crisis was passing. "Growing up hungry teaches you to keep supplies. But yes, the enhanced metabolism means I need more available calories than most people realize. Especially after—" He gestured vaguely at the destroyed dummy.

Zara sat down on the bench beside him, close enough that their shoulders almost touched. Not quite contact, but proximity that spoke of support. "That level of capability, those limitations—it changes tactical planning significantly. We need to account for metabolic requirements, recovery time, frequency restrictions."

"Which is why I showed you," Kyr4n said quietly. He'd finished his fifth protein bar and started on another energy gel pack, the sugar and complex carbohydrates already beginning to restore his depleted reserves. "You were right. If you're going to coordinate with me, if you're going to put people in the field where my capabilities matter—you need to understand both what I can do and what it costs me."

Marcus looked at the demolished dummy again, really processing what he'd witnessed. The precision. The devastating efficiency. The way Kyr4n had dismantled a Level 12 combat machine—programmed to simulate elite augmented fighters—in twenty-three seconds flat.

And the way he'd nearly collapsed afterward, body demanding fuel to recover from an expenditure that would have killed a normal human outright.

"You avoid this," Alex said, and there was awe in his voice still, mixed with understanding. "Every time. That's why you stay off the front lines, why you delegate field work. When you do engage—those rare moments—you're measuring out just enough to end it fast while dealing with the metabolic cost afterward where nobody sees."

"It's safer that way," Kyr4n said, and Marcus heard the weight behind those words. "For everyone. I avoid field work because—" He stopped, jaw clenching. "Because when I let go like that, when I stop holding back, it's hard to... calibrate. To know where the line is between stopping a threat and going too far. Even against enemies." He glanced at the smoking remains of the dummy. "Better to stay off the front lines than risk crossing that line with a person."

"Except now we know," Zara said. Her voice carried weight—not accusation, but acknowledgment. "So we can plan better. Support better. Make sure you've got what you need."

Marcus saw Kyr4n's throat work as he swallowed, and it wasn't just the energy gel. The vulnerability of being known, of having the truth witnessed in its entirety—it sat heavy in the space between them.

"Thank you," Kyr4n said finally, so quietly Marcus almost missed it. "For not—for not looking at me differently."

"We're looking at you exactly the same," Marcus corrected firmly. "Someone who's been carrying too much alone for too long. Someone who doesn't have to anymore."

Zara's hand moved—not quite touching Kyr4n's shoulder, but close. That careful distance maintained even now, professional boundaries respected, but the gesture of support clear nonetheless.

Alex was already making notes on his tablet, that tactical mind cataloging information, building new operational frameworks around these revelations. "We'll need protocols for the rare situations where you have no choice but to engage. If you're burning through calories like that, we need high-density nutrition accessible. Emergency reserves."

"And after," Marcus added. "Recovery protocols. For those times when you can't avoid it. We can't have you collapsing because we didn't prepare for the worst case."

"I've been managing—" Kyr4n started.

"Alone," Zara interrupted gently. "You've been managing alone. Now you're not."

The training room's lights hummed overhead, steady and constant. The destroyed dummy lay in smoldering ruins, sections of its steel frame still glowing dull red, the acrid smell of burnt leather and melted gel hanging heavy in the air.

He watched something shift in Kyr4n's expression—that perpetual guardedness cracking just a little more. Not breaking. Just... opening. Enough to let them in.

"Okay," Kyr4n said. "Okay. We'll adjust protocols."

Marcus nodded, satisfied. It was progress—real progress. Not just understanding Kyr4n's capabilities, but understanding the person beneath them. The one who'd been fighting battles on two fronts simultaneously: external enemies and the internal cost of being something other than human while desperately trying to protect humanity.

"Can you stand?" Marcus asked.

Kyr4n tested his legs, pushing himself up from the bench with visible effort. He swayed slightly but held steady, that enhanced metabolism already beginning to restore his depleted reserves. "Yeah. I'm good."

"Not yet, but getting there." Marcus picked up the remaining protein bars and pressed them into Kyr4n's hands. "Keep eating. I'll arrange for proper recovery meals from the kitchen. High protein, complex carbs, good fats."

"You don't have to—"

"I know." Marcus met his eyes steadily. "That's not the point."

Behind them, Alex was already on his comm calling about disposing of the destroyed dummy and probably requisitioning new training equipment. The steel frame would need to cool for hours before it could be safely moved. Zara stayed close to Kyr4n, that protective proximity speaking volumes about loyalty earned through shared truth and maintained boundaries.

And Marcus thought about family—not the kind you're born into, but the kind you build from choices and trust and moments like this. Moments where secrets became shared knowledge, where vulnerability became strength, where isolation transformed into connection.

The compound's evening shift would be starting soon. There would be people to coordinate, operations to plan, territories to protect. The work never stopped in this precarious empire they'd built from necessity and stubborn refusal to abandon their community.

But for now, in this training room that smelled of ozone and sweat and hard-won trust, they had what mattered most.

They had each other.

They had the truth.

All of it.
