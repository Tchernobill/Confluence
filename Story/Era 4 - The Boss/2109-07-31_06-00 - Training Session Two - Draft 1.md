Zara arrived at the training facility at 0600 again, bringing proper equipment this time—heavier striking pads, resistance gear, a training dummy designed to withstand enhanced strikes. She'd planned escalated drills, stress testing, pushing him until whatever limits he had became visible.

She expected him not to show. Expected Marcus to arrive with apologies about the Boss being too injured to train, needing recovery time after yesterday's insanity.

Kyr4n was already there.

Standing in the centre of the mat, wearing actual training clothes this time—simple black pants, fitted compression shirt. No visible injuries. No bruising. No swelling. Moving through basic forms with fluid precision, testing range of motion.

Like yesterday hadn't happened.

Zara stopped in the doorway, staring. "You've got to be fucking kidding me."

He turned, pausing mid-movement. "Good morning."

"Good morning? You took hits yesterday that should have hospitalized you for weeks. Broken ribs. Facial trauma. Internal bleeding. And you look like—" She gestured at him, frustrated. "—like you had a good night's sleep and maybe a light workout."

"Dr. Vasquez checked me last night," Kyr4n said. "She cleared me for light training."

"Light training."

"Yes. Though—" He touched his left side carefully. "—she did recommend going easy on the ribs. Still some residual soreness."

Zara crossed the training floor, stopping a few feet away, her enhanced vision scanning for damage markers. Found almost nothing. Faint yellow-green bruising at his jawline, barely visible. Slight movement restriction when he breathed deep. That was it.

"What are you?" she asked again, knowing he wouldn't answer but unable to stop herself.

"Someone who heals quickly," Kyr4n said. "Can we proceed with training?"

She wanted to push. Wanted to demand real answers. But yesterday's conversation with Marcus echoed—_sometimes you accept what you don't understand and move forward anyway._

"Fine," she said, dropping her equipment bag. "Let's see what you remember from yesterday's forms."

Kyr4n moved through the basic stance sequence. And immediately, Zara noticed the difference.

His form was better. Significantly better. Weight distribution more balanced, guard position tighter, footwork showing actual technique instead of graceless stumbling. Not perfect—still too mechanical, lacking the fluid muscle memory of real training. But improved in ways that shouldn't be possible after one session.

"Stop," she said. "Did you train last night?"

"No. But I did some reading."

"Reading."

"On fighting styles. Technique fundamentals. Bio-mechanical efficiency in combat movement." He demonstrated a proper jab—still not perfect, but dramatically improved from yesterday. "Marcus also provided some video references of professional matches. Observing proper form helped clarify the concepts."

Zara stared. "You learned technique improvements from _reading_ overnight?"

"The theoretical understanding was helpful. Applying it is more difficult, but—" He threw another combination, noticeably better structured. "—having the framework makes the practice more efficient."

"That's..." Zara searched for words. "...not how combat training works. You need muscle memory. Repetition. You can't just read about technique and suddenly execute better."

"Apparently I can," Kyr4n said. "Is that unusual?"

"Yes. Extremely." She moved closer, adjusting his stance with professional hands. "Most people need hundreds of hours to internalize what you're showing after one night of reading. Your body's learning rate is abnormal."

"Good abnormal or concerning abnormal?"

"I don't know yet." She stepped back, thoughtful. "What's your fighting style? Not what you're learning—what comes naturally?"

Kyr4n considered. "I don't think I have one. Yesterday with Behemoth, I just... responded. Targeted weak points. Avoided damage. No formal technique, just problem-solving in real time."

"Technical fighting," Zara said. "Like a mechanic rather than a warrior. That tracks with how you moved—terrible form but precise targeting." She demonstrated her own stance—fluid, aggressive, optimized for close-quarters lethality. "My style is direct. Overwhelming force, precision strikes, minimal wasted movement. Trained for assassination—incapacitate or kill within the first few seconds."

"Efficient."

"Deadly." She moved through a rapid combination, each strike placed with surgical accuracy. "What about Marcus? He's been training you?"

"He recommended boxing. Said it would be good for building upper body technique without requiring the leg work I'm less comfortable with."

Zara snorted. "Of course he did. Marcus's style is about fifty years out of date. Classical military combatives—serviceable but antiquated. He fights like they're going to put his technique in a museum exhibit." She caught Kyr4n's expression. "Don't tell him I said that."

"Your secret is safe."

"Good. Because he's also a decent teacher, and I'd rather not insult him to his face." She pulled on striking pads. "Now, let's drill those combinations again. I want to see how much that overnight reading actually helped."

They trained for the next forty minutes, working through progressively complex sequences. Kyr4n's improvement was consistent—still learning, still mechanical, but absorbing technique with unsettling speed. His spatial awareness remained uncanny, always knowing where she was, adjusting distance perfectly.

But something was missing.

"Okay," Zara said finally, setting down the pads. "Light sparring. Quarter speed, just testing your defensive responses. I want to see how you actually react under pressure."

"Understood."

She moved in, throwing careful combinations—testing blocks, checking his guard, probing for openings. All controlled. Professional. Training pace.

Kyr4n's defense was adequate. Good spatial awareness, quick reflexes, decent positioning. But nothing like yesterday. No exceptional speed. No surprising power. Just competent baseline human responses with maybe slightly better reaction time.

She increased tempo to half speed. Same result—solid defense, nothing extraordinary.

"Strange," she said, circling. "Yesterday you moved faster than this. Hit harder. Your reflexes were borderline supernatural."

"Was I?" Kyr4n maintained his guard, tracking her movement.

"Yes. Definitely." She threw a faster combination, testing. His blocks were competent but unremarkable. "But now you're just... normal. Well-trained normal, maybe, but nothing like what you showed with Behemoth."

"Perhaps the situation was different."

"Different how?"

Kyr4n paused, considering his words. "Yesterday was life-or-death. Real threat. Real stakes. Maybe my body responds differently when genuinely threatened."

"And I'm not threatening enough?" Zara kept her tone light, but something cold settled in her gut.

"We're training. Same team. Same side." He shrugged. "Maybe because you're not actually a threat, I don't respond the same way."

The words hung in the air.

_Not a threat._

Zara stopped moving. Processed what he'd just said. Felt something hot and angry unfurl in her chest.

"Not a threat," she repeated quietly.

"In the context of training," Kyr4n clarified, apparently not noticing the shift in her tone. "Obviously in combat you'd be extremely dangerous. Your augmentations, training, experience—"

"I am _always_ a threat," Zara interrupted, voice dropping. "In every room I enter. Every situation I'm in. That's what I am. That's what I've built myself to be. The predator. The apex. The one everyone else fears."

Kyr4n lowered his guard slightly, confusion showing. "I didn't mean—"

"You said I'm not a threat." She moved closer, her enhanced musculature tensing. "That's not training context. That's assessment. And your assessment is _wrong_."

"Zara—"

"Prove it," she said flatly. "Show me that I'm not a threat. Defend yourself like I actually matter."

She attacked.

Not training pace. Not controlled combinations. Real speed. Real force. The kind of assault she'd use on an actual target—overwhelming aggression designed to incapacitate within seconds.

Kyr4n's defense shifted immediately—faster, more precise, that uncanny awareness kicking in. But she was enhanced. Trained. _Angry_. She pressed harder, combinations flowing into each other, finding angles, exploiting openings.

He blocked, deflected, gave ground. Good defense. Maybe even excellent defense.

But it wasn't _enough_.

She wasn't satisfied with good defense. Wasn't satisfied with him surviving. She wanted—needed—to see him recognize her as dangerous. To feel that predatory superiority that defined her. To be the apex predator in this room like she was everywhere else.

"Fight back," she growled, increasing pressure.

"This isn't training anymore," Kyr4n said, still defending, not striking. "Zara, stop—"

"_Make me._"

She drove forward with a combination that would have dropped most opponents—enhanced strength behind every strike, augmented speed making her movements blur. Found his guard. Slipped past it. Connected with his shoulder, his ribs—

He caught her wrist mid-strike.

Not gentle. Not training contact. _Caught_—grip like iron, stopping her enhanced punch dead.

Before she could process that, he moved.

Twisted her arm. Used her own momentum. Swept her legs with mechanical precision. She went down hard, face-first into the mat, air exploding from her lungs. His foot came down on her back—not crushing, but immovable. His hand still held her wrist, pulled up and back at an angle that sent warning signals through her augmented nervous system. Not quite painful. Not yet. But promising pain if she struggled.

Submission hold. Perfect execution. She was completely controlled.

Zara froze. Enhanced combat systems screaming at her that she was pinned, dominated, helpless. The predator instincts that defined her encountering a simple, impossible fact:

She wasn't the apex predator in this room.

Kyr4n held the position for five seconds. Ten. Long enough for the reality to sink in. Long enough for her to feel the absolute control he had over her body. Then—

He released her. Stepped back. Hands raised in non-aggression.

"That was a bad idea," he said quietly. "Training is suspended. For now."

He turned and walked toward the exit, not running, not aggressive. Just... leaving.

The door slid shut behind him.

Zara lay on the mat for a moment, breathing hard, processing. Her enhanced cardiovascular system had already regulated her respiration. Her augmented muscles showed no fatigue. Physically, she was fine.

Psychologically, she was reeling.

She pushed herself up to sitting, then standing. Tested her wrist—no damage. Checked her mobility—full range of motion. He'd controlled her completely without actually hurting her.

That might be worse.

She'd been pinned before. Training accidents, early in her augmentation when she was still learning her capabilities. But not since. Not in years. Not since she'd become what she was—the enhanced killer who walked into rooms and made everyone else step back.

Kyr4n had put her face-down on the mat like she was a trainee. Like she was _baseline_. Like her augmentations and training and years of killing meant nothing.

And he'd done it _easily_.

No strain. No struggle. Just mechanical application of leverage and superior positioning. Like he'd been holding back the entire time and finally decided to show her what he could actually do.

_Not a threat,_ he'd said.

To him, she wasn't.

Zara walked to the bench, sat down, stared at her hands. Enhanced muscles. Augmented reflexes. Corporate training that had turned her into a weapon. All of it bypassed by someone with terrible combat form and mysterious capabilities.

She should be angry. Should be furious at the humiliation, the defeat, the casual dominance.

But underneath the anger, something else stirred. Something she didn't want to examine too closely.

Interest.

For years—since her augmentations, since corporate training transformed her—she'd been the strongest person in any room. The deadliest. The one everyone else feared. Alone at the top of the hierarchy because no one could challenge her.

Lonely at the apex.

And now—suddenly—there was someone stronger. Someone who could dominate her with the same casual ease she dominated others. Someone who could pin her, control her, prove she wasn't actually the ultimate predator she'd believed herself to be.

Someone who _matched_ her.

Or exceeded her.

The thought should terrify her. Should trigger all her survival instincts screaming danger.

Instead, she felt... something else. Something she didn't have words for. Attraction wasn't quite right—too simple. Fascination was closer. The recognition of a force that could actually challenge her, actually push back, actually _matter_ in a way baseline humans never could.

Power responding to greater power.

Predator recognizing apex predator.

And beneath all of that, quieter but more unsettling: the memory of being held down. Controlled. Dominated. The feeling of complete helplessness that should have triggered panic but instead...

She shut down that line of thinking immediately.

Professional assessment only. She was his bodyguard. He was her employer. The dynamic had just shifted from "protect the vulnerable civilian" to "protect the apex predator who happens to look like a vulnerable civilian." That required tactical recalibration.

Nothing more.

She stood, gathering her equipment with mechanical precision. Forced her enhanced nervous system to calm, her augmented muscles to relax. Professional mode. Analytical mode.

But as she headed for the exit, she caught sight of herself in the mirrored wall. Saw the faint flush on her cheeks that wasn't from exertion. The slight dilation of her pupils that her tactical wetware flagged as arousal response.

"Fuck," she whispered.

This was going to be complicated.

She'd agreed to protect Kyr4n thinking he was a puzzle to solve, an unusual client who needed her expertise. But puzzles didn't pin you to the mat. Puzzles didn't prove you weren't the apex predator you thought you were.

Puzzles didn't make you wonder what it would feel like to submit to strength greater than your own.

She shut that thought down harder, exiting the training facility into the corridor. Walking with precise military bearing back toward her quarters. Processing. Analyzing. Trying to categorize what had just happened into professional context.

Failing.

Because professional context didn't explain the part of her that wanted to go back. To push him again. To test those boundaries. To find out exactly how much power he actually possessed and whether it would be enough to—

_Stop._

Professional relationship. Employer and bodyguard. Nothing more.

She repeated it like a mantra all the way back to her quarters.

Didn't quite believe it.

Behind her, in the empty training facility, the mat still held the impression where she'd been pinned. Evidence of a moment that had shifted something fundamental in her understanding of herself.

She wasn't the apex predator.

She'd just found someone who was.

And part of her—the part she wasn't ready to acknowledge—wanted to find out what that meant.
