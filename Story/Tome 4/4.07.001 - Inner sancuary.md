The door to Kyr4n's private quarters slid open with barely a whisper, revealing a space that somehow managed to feel both lived-in and carefully curated. Unlike the sterile efficiency of his office or the tactical precision of the command center, this was unmistakably a home.

"Welcome to my place," Kyr4n said, bare foot, gesturing for them to enter. "Please, relax. This is the one place in the entire compound where I insist on being just another person."

Jin was the first through the door, immediately gravitating toward a battered couch that looked infinitely more comfortable than anything in the common areas. He collapsed onto it with an exaggerated groan of satisfaction. "Oh, this is heaven. Where did you even find furniture this comfortable in the slums?"

"Phoenix Recovery," Kyr4n replied with a slight smile. "Some habits die hard."

Kaia moved through the space like water, her fingers trailing along surfaces, examining everything with the calculating eye of someone who read rooms the way others read books. She paused at the bookshelf, head tilting as she took in the eclectic collection—technical manuals mixed with philosophy, repair guides alongside poetry.

"Fascinating," she murmured, pulling out a worn copy of Meditations by Marcus Aurelius. "A man who rebuilds broken machines reads about rebuilding broken souls."

Helen chose a chair near the window, her medical bag set carefully beside her feet. She'd kept her shoes on, Kyr4n noticed, a small armor against vulnerability even here. Alex remained standing by the door at first, his military training making him map exits and sight lines before anything else.

Marcus stood at attention near the entrance until Kyr4n caught his eye. "Marcus."

"Sir?"

"In here, there's no 'sir.' No ranks, no hierarchy. Just people who trust each other enough to share a drink and honest conversation."

The big man's shoulders relaxed incrementally. "That's... going to take some adjustment."

"Take your time," Kyr4n said, moving to a small bar tucked into the corner. "The usual for everyone?"

It was a small thing, but the fact that he knew their preferences—Jin's preference for beer over anything fancy, Kaia's appreciation for good wine, Marcus's unexpected fondness for whiskey neat, Helen's careful single glass of whatever was offered, Alex's preference for staying sharp with just water—spoke volumes about his attention to the people around him.

"You know," Kaia said, accepting a glass of surprisingly good Merlot, "you're almost disappointingly normal in here. Where are the mysterious glowing circuits? The incomprehensible technology? The dramatic lighting?"

"Left those in my other apartment," Kyr4n replied dryly, settling into his own chair with a simple glass of water. "This one just has books and questionable furniture choices."

The evening progressed with the kind of easy conversation that only came from shared danger and growing trust. Jin regaled them with stories from his underground clinic days—the man who'd tried to pay for surgery with a cybernetic arm he'd "found" (still attached to someone else), the corporate executive who'd come in with a neural virus from a black market implant and insisted it was just a headache.

Helen shared carefully edited stories from her time in corporate medical, the absurdity of treating executives for stress-related conditions while they created those same conditions in thousands of workers.

"I once had a board member come in with severe anxiety," she said, swirling her wine thoughtfully. "He was terrified that the workers were planning something. This was the same week his company had cut medical benefits for all ground-floor employees. The irony was completely lost on him."

Alex and Marcus found common ground in military experiences, comparing notes on operations that had gone sideways in spectacularly similar ways despite being on opposite sides of corporate conflicts.

"There's something universal about military incompetence," Alex observed. "Doesn't matter which corporation's flag you're under, there's always some executive who thinks they understand tactics because they played strategy games in college."

As the evening wore on and alcohol loosened tongues, the conversation drifted to more personal territories. Kaia, now on her third glass of wine, had positioned herself on the arm of Kyr4n's chair, one hand gesturing expressively as she spoke.

"You know what I find most attractive about you?" she said, her Nigerian accent becoming more pronounced with the wine. "It's not the mystery or the power, darling. It's the competence. Do you have any idea how rare it is to find someone who actually knows what they're doing?"

"Careful, Kaia," Kyr4n deflected with a slight smile. "Jin might get jealous."

"I'm very secure in my relationship with my work," Jin protested, though his ears had gone slightly red. "Besides, Kaia already told me my forearms are 'surprisingly appealing' last week."

"They are," Helen said with clinical detachment. "Good muscle definition, prominent veins. Medically speaking, you'd be easy to insert an IV into."

"That's... the weirdest compliment I've ever received," Jin muttered, though he was clearly pleased.

The laughter that followed felt real, unguarded in a way that was rare in their world. It was in that moment of comfortable silence that followed, everyone settled into their own thoughts, that Kyr4n made his decision.
