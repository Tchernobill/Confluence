## Tome 4, Chapter 1: Top of the Tower

The tower stank of fear.

Marcus had worked security for Rico "The Grip" Vasquez for three years now, long enough to recognize the particular scent that permeated every surface of the building. It wasn't just the industrial disinfectant they used to mop the lobby floors twice daily, or the ozone smell from the weapon scanners, or even the lingering copper tang of blood that seemed to seep from the walls themselves. It was something deeper. More visceral.

It was the smell of people who knew they could disappear.

He stood in the lobby, chrome-plated forearms crossed over his chest, and watched the elevators descend from the upper floors. His augmented vision tracked the indicator lights with mechanical precision, counting down from eighteen. Behind him, Dr. Chen waited with her medical scanner, a nervous woman in a pristine white coat who'd learned long ago not to ask questions about the bruises she catalogued.

The job was simple enough: retrieve one Kyr4n—street name "The Artisant"—and escort him to the penthouse. Rico wanted a meeting. Rico always got what he wanted.

Marcus's jaw tightened. It had been that kind of week. That kind of month, really. Yesterday, he'd stood outside Rico's office for two hours while the boss "disciplined" one of the working girls. The sounds had been methodical. Professional. Rico took pride in his work, in knowing exactly how much pressure to apply before something broke.

Before someone broke.

The elevator chimed. Marcus straightened, his military training overriding three years of moral fatigue. First impressions mattered in this business. Show weakness, show doubt, and you became the next lesson in consequences.

The doors slid open.

The man who stepped out wasn't what Marcus expected.

Kyr4n moved with the kind of economy that came from understanding exactly where his body was in space—no wasted motion, no unnecessary flourish. He was younger than Marcus had imagined, maybe mid-twenties, with dark hair that fell just past his collar and the kind of lean build that suggested functional strength rather than augmented muscle. His clothes were unremarkable: dark jacket, practical boots, nothing that would stand out in a crowd.

But his eyes.

Marcus's augmented vision automatically ran a threat assessment, cataloguing details his conscious mind would need seconds to process. Kyr4n's eyes were the color of winter steel, flat and evaluative, moving across the lobby with the same clinical precision Marcus had seen in military reconnaissance specialists. Not darting nervously like most people Rico summoned. Not wide with fear. Just... assessing.

Cataloguing.

Planning.

"Kyr4n?" Marcus kept his voice level, professional. "I'm Marcus. Mr. Vasquez is expecting you."

The man's gaze shifted to him, and Marcus felt an irrational urge to step back. There was something in that look—not hostility, not aggression, just a complete absence of concern. Like Marcus was a piece of equipment whose function had already been calculated and filed away as irrelevant.

"I know." Kyr4n's voice was quiet, almost conversational. "The summons was quite clear about the consequences of refusal."

Marcus grunted. At least this one understood the rules. "Weapons first. All of them. Including blades."

Kyr4n's expression didn't change. "I don't carry weapons."

"Everyone carries weapons." Marcus had heard that lie a thousand times. Usually right before he found a knife in a boot or a ceramic blade sewn into a collar.

"I don't."

The words were delivered with the same flat certainty, not defensive, not challenging. Just a statement of fact, delivered by someone who didn't particularly care whether Marcus believed him or not.

Marcus's enhanced vision ran a scan, looking for the telltale bulges of concealed armament, the slight asymmetry in clothing that suggested hidden compartments. Nothing visible, but that didn't mean much. "We'll see. Dr. Chen?"

The doctor approached with her medical scanner raised like a protective talisman, her voice slightly too high. "Arms out, please."

Kyr4n complied without comment, spreading his arms in the universal gesture of cooperation. The scanner hummed as it traced patterns across his body, projecting a ghostly blue outline into the air between them.

"Neural I/O port," Kyr4n said, before Dr. Chen could ask. "Left wrist. Standard interface, commercially available. Nothing proprietary."

The doctor's scanner confirmed his statement, highlighting a small port at his wrist—a circular interface no larger than a fingertip, common enough among tech workers and engineers. The scan continued, sweeping methodically across his entire frame.

"Any other implants?" Dr. Chen asked, following her checklist with religious devotion. The checklist kept her safe. The checklist meant she was just doing her job, not making decisions that might anger Rico later.

"No."

The scanner completed its sweep, projecting a clean readout that made Marcus frown. No hidden weapons. No combat augmentation. No dermal plating or bone reinforcement. No concealed blades in boot heels or ceramic weapons sewn into fabric. Just the neural port and what appeared to be an entirely baseline human physique.

"He's clean," Dr. Chen announced, stepping back with visible relief. "Just the neural port. No weapons, no other implants, nothing hidden."

Marcus studied Kyr4n with renewed suspicion. The Artisant had built a reputation over the past few years as a craftsman who could coax miracles from broken electronics—not just repairs, but genuine innovations that shouldn't be possible with slum-grade tools. The kind of work that caught Rico's attention.

But there was something else. Something in the way this completely unaugmented tech worker stood in Rico's lobby without a trace of fear. Most people summoned to this tower were either trembling or hiding it badly. Combat augs could explain that kind of calm—reflex boosters and adrenaline regulators that kept you steady under pressure.

But this man had nothing. No augmentation. No weapons. Just a baseline human nervous system and a gaze that calculated trajectories like a targeting computer.

Something didn't add up.

"Follow me," Marcus said finally, gesturing toward the elevators.

They crossed the lobby in silence, their footsteps echoing off walls that had witnessed too many arrivals and too few departures. The tower was one of the better structures in Rico's territory—a converted pre-Renewal office building that still had most of its original infrastructure intact. But three years of Rico's presence had transformed it into something else. The marble floors were too clean, scrubbed daily by people who knew that bloodstains were evidence of failure. The air recyclers hummed too loud, working overtime to mask smells that shouldn't exist in a legitimate business.

The elevator doors opened like a mouth, and Marcus gestured Kyr4n inside.

Eighteen floors. Plenty of time for the speech.

Marcus pressed the button for the penthouse and felt the elevator lurch into motion, the ancient machinery grinding through decades of neglect. The building might look maintained on the surface, but underneath, it was rotting. Just like everything Rico touched.

"First time meeting Mr. Vasquez?" Marcus asked, breaking the silence as the elevator climbed past the third floor.

"Yes."

No elaboration. No nervous chatter. Most people couldn't handle the silence when they were being summoned to Rico's office, couldn't stop themselves from filling the void with words that usually made their situation worse. But Kyr4n just stood there, hands loose at his sides, watching the floor indicator with that same clinical detachment.

Marcus cleared his throat. "There are rules. You'll want to follow them."

The man's eyes shifted to him—not his face, Marcus noticed, but his hands. Like Kyr4n was calculating how quickly Marcus could draw a weapon, how much reach that chrome-plated augmentation provided.

"Rule one," Marcus continued, forcing his voice into the professional monotone he'd perfected over three years. "Don't engage Mr. Vasquez in conversation. Answer when he speaks to you. Don't volunteer information. Don't ask questions. Don't explain unless he asks for an explanation."

Kyr4n nodded once. A single, economical movement that conveyed understanding without agreement.

"Rule two: Don't approach him. Ever. Mr. Vasquez has multiple protection enhancements—proximity triggers that will deliver a very painful lesson to anyone not specifically authorized to be within his personal space. I've seen people convulse for twenty minutes from a three-second zap."

"Understood."

The elevator climbed past the tenth floor. Eight more to go.

"Rule three: Minimize direct eye contact. Prolonged staring can be interpreted as a challenge. Mr. Vasquez doesn't like challenges." Marcus's voice went flat, the professional mask slipping just enough to show what three years of witnessing Rico's reactions had cost him.

"He likes compliance," Kyr4n observed, his tone unchanged.

It wasn't a question. He said it the same way someone might note that water was wet or gravity pulled downward—just an observable fact about the universe.

"He likes control," Marcus corrected. "Compliance is just the visible proof of it."

Something flickered across Kyr4n's face—not quite a smile, not quite recognition, just a subtle shift in the muscles around his mouth that suggested he understood the distinction.

They passed the fifteenth floor. The elevator's grinding became more pronounced, the ancient machinery protesting the weight of too many years and too little maintenance. Like everything in the slum, it was held together by jury-rigged repairs and borrowed time.

"And a personal tip," Marcus added, meeting those steel-colored eyes for a brief moment before looking away. "When interacting with Mr. Vasquez, imagine you're handling a barrel of nitroglycerin. Every word, every gesture, every fucking breath could set him off. He _enjoys_ pain. Other people's pain."

The elevator shuddered to a stop. The doors opened onto the anteroom of Rico's penthouse—a space that should have been impressive with its salvaged furniture and functioning climate control, but instead felt like the waiting room of a dentist who enjoyed his work a little too much.

"Yes, Sir," Kyr4n said quietly, stepping out into the anteroom.

The word came out perfectly neutral, carrying exactly the right amount of respect without a trace of sarcasm or subservience. Like he'd studied the precise tone required for military courtesy and could reproduce it at will.

Marcus felt a chill run down his spine that had nothing to do with the climate control. This baseline, unaugmented tech worker had just demonstrated better tactical awareness than most of the combat-aug mercs Rico employed. Reading the situation, adapting his behavior, showing respect at exactly the right moment to ease potential friction.

The Artisant was either very, very smart, or very, very dangerous.

Possibly both.

Marcus led the way across thick carpet that muffled their footsteps, past walls decorated with tasteful art that had been stolen from corporate executives who'd made the mistake of refusing Rico's protection offers. Everything here was chosen to project power, to remind visitors that Rico Vasquez took what he wanted and displayed his victories for all to see.

The door to Rico's office was heavy oak, another salvage piece that had probably cost more than most people in the slum earned in a year. Marcus could hear sounds from inside—rhythmic, violent, punctuated by gasps that might have been pain or pleasure or the desperate performance of someone who knew their survival depended on convincing their tormentor that brutality was pleasure.

His hand hesitated on the door handle. Three years of this job, and he still felt his stomach turn every time he knocked. Every time he opened this door and witnessed what passed for Rico's idea of recreation.

But he'd made his choice long ago, when his military pension ran out and his wife's medical bills came due. When the only jobs available to an ex-military security specialist were either corporate drone or criminal muscle. He'd chosen the latter, told himself it was temporary, told himself he'd find a way out.

Three years later, he was still telling himself those lies.

Marcus knocked—three sharp raps that announced his presence without demanding attention.

Waited.

The sounds inside shifted, changed. Movement. The rustle of fabric. A muffled sob that was quickly stifled.

"Enter," Rico's voice called out, carrying that particular tone of satisfaction that made Marcus's chrome-plated fingers curl into fists.

He opened the door.

And immediately wished he hadn't.
