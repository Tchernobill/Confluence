- A representative of Kyr4n's organisation, (Aurelio Marchetti, a charismatic face, charming manners, masterful negotiation skills),  is meeting with a representative of the Guild of Traders and Merchants of the South Shore Slum to make a new, more formal, agreement with them.

- Previously, Rico The Grip would just make them pay protection money, but Kyr4n sent a representative to talk and secure a cooperation agreement instead.

- Aurelio state that agreement with the guild is very important to Kyr4n.
- Someone ask why Kyr4n didn't came himself then?

- Aurelio politely explain that Kyr4n is currently engaged in the middle of a territory consolidation but just contacted him (seamlessly via mind-to-mind comm, considered rare and exotic tech), who just agreed to drop his current engagement and will be present in 15 minutes. ' "They saw his eyes lose focus for just a moment. "—I'm contacting him now. If the council would prefer to speak directly with him, it would be a pleasure to arrange that." '

- While waiting, Isa Mercer, is a founding member of the Guild, knowing Kyr4n is coming, ask some members in private to disclose her past connection with Kyr4n. David suggest she watch remotely if preferable.

- Kyr4n is approaching, outside, 3 small patrol drones arrive, scan the surrounding, then Kyr4n's motorbike arrive. As he dismount, a 4th tailing drone arrive and they all re-integrate Kyr4n's vehicle.

- As Kyr4n enter the room, he is introduce by Aurelio (a bit too much to Kyr4n's taste).

- They began talking. Early in the talk, Aurelio point to the empty chair and before a member can answer (about Isa's abscence) , Kyr4n reply that it's not an issue (secret: he know it's Isa seat and understand her acscence)

- Near the end of the conversation, a council woman ask Kyr4n a different question. The agreement terms still seem so good that it is difficult not to see it like a very cleverly designed trap and that's why despite everything, they are still suspicious.

- Kyr4n will say that cooperation is better than exploitation, will explain, in a philosophical way, that in nature, life is about survival, individuals gathering ressources in order to "win". Things went a different way when human's ancestors started to cooperate together, it gave humans an edge on everything else in that grand competition. Greed is a natural instinct ingraved deep within us so it often resurface, but it seep things stagnants, only cooperations lead forward to the next step. 




The weakest individuals became the strongest collective.

## Guild of Traders and Merchants

Board Members
### David Thomson
**Position**: Founding Board Member / De Facto Chair
**Age**: Mid-60s
**Background**: 30+ years in underground commerce, formerly ran a components brokerage network
**Description**: Methodical and analytical, David built his reputation on careful risk assessment and long-term thinking. Wears wire-rimmed glasses and favours practical business attire. His calm demeanour masks sharp intelligence and decades of survival experience. Known for asking the right questions rather than providing easy answers.

Personality Traits:
- Cautiously optimistic
- Values documentation and process
- Thinks three moves ahead
- Protective of Guild members but pragmatic about necessary risks
- Rarely shows emotion but deeply cares about community

Stance on Phoenix Rising:
Cautiously supportive. Recognizes the proposal's structural soundness and sees potential benefits, but insists on verification mechanisms and trial periods. Views cooperation as calculated risk management rather than trust. His "trust, but verify" approach reflects years of navigating dangerous alliances. Voted to accept primarily because the contract's termination clauses provide adequate protection.

### Fatima al-Rashid
**Position**: Founding Board Member / Logistics Coordinator
**Age**: Late 40s
**Background**: Former corporate supply chain manager who fell from grace after whistleblowing, built new life coordinating slum trade networks
**Description**: Elegant despite years in the slum, Fatima maintains professional bearing and speaks with precision. Her experience with corporate logistics gives her insight into both legitimate and underground operations. Known for asking uncomfortable questions that expose hidden assumptions.

Personality Traits:
- Sceptical but fair-minded
- Values efficiency and clear communication
- Empathetic but not sentimental
- Sees patterns others miss
- Protective of vulnerable merchants

Stance on Phoenix Rising:
Cautiously positive with reservations. Appreciates the professional structure and transparent accountability mechanisms, which remind her of functional corporate systems. Concerned that sophistication might mask exploitation, but recognizes that Rico's brutal approach was definitively worse. Her decades of corporate experience make her wary of promises, but she's willing to test Phoenix Rising's claims. First to raise her hand in the vote, signalling pragmatic acceptance.

### Thomas Kovač
**Position**: Founding Board Member / Security Liaison
**Age**: Early 50s
**Background**: Former enforcer for various organizations who became disillusioned with violence, now advocates for merchant protection through collective action
**Description**: Heavily augmented with visible tech, Thomas's imposing physical presence contrasts with his surprisingly thoughtful approach. His thick fingers and bulk barely fit standard furniture, but he moves with careful precision. Speaks bluntly but not cruelly, values direct communication over diplomatic hedging.

Personality Traits:
- Blunt and direct
- Values actions over words
- Protective instincts channelled into community security
- Suspicious of power structures due to personal experience
- Surprisingly gentle despite intimidating appearance

Stance on Phoenix Rising:
Sceptical acceptance. His experience with criminal organizations makes him inherently distrustful of benevolent promises. However, his independent verification of improved conditions in Rico's former territory carries significant weight. The contract's professional structure impresses him despite his wariness. His question about trust fundamentally captures his concern—that sophisticated exploitation is still exploitation. Voted to accept because evidence outweighs suspicion, but remains alert for betrayal.

### Maria Santos
**Position**: Board Member (Newest)
**Age**: Mid-30s
**Background**: Second-generation merchant who built successful textile operation, joined board two years ago representing younger merchant perspective
**Description**: Energetic and idealistic, Maria represents the generation that grew up entirely in slum economics. Less scarred by corporate betrayal than older members, but carries fresh wounds from Rico's era. Often asks questions from perspective of street-level merchants rather than established operators.

Personality Traits:
- Idealistic but not naive
- Values transparency and fairness
- Quick to spot inconsistencies
- Represents younger merchant concerns
- Wants to believe in positive change

Stance on Phoenix Rising:
Hopeful but cautious. She wasn't present during Rico's worst excesses but heard enough stories to be wary. Her youth makes her more open to the possibility that Phoenix Rising genuinely offers something different, but her recent experiences with broken promises create hesitation. Questions whether dependence on protection could become a trap. Voted to accept because she wants to believe improvement is possible, but insists on maintaining Guild independence.

### Isa Mercer
**Position**: Founding Board Member / Business Operations Specialist
**Age**: 34
**Background**: Former underground implant dealer and Phoenix Recovery co-founder, helped establish Guild three years ago
**Description**: Emotionally intelligent with natural ability to read people and situations. Moves with practiced confidence earned through years of underground commerce. Known for fair dealing and practical wisdom. Her circuit-pattern UV tattoo marks her dealer origins, but she's transcended that identity to become respected business leader.

Personality Traits:
- Pragmatically optimistic
- Values second chances and rehabilitation
- Emotionally intelligent but guarded about personal matters
- Believes in building rather than exploiting
- Balances idealism with practical experience

Stance on Phoenix Rising:
Professionally supportive despite personal complications. Her history with Kyr4n provides unique insight into his foundational philosophy, but seven years of separation means she's assessing current capability rather than past relationship. Believes Phoenix Rising's proposal reflects genuine evolution of principles she helped establish at Phoenix Recovery. Her vote to accept despite conflict of interest demonstrates confidence that the contract benefits the Guild regardless of personal history. Most conflicted member emotionally, but most certain member professionally.
