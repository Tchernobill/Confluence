## Character Notes

- **Zara**: Shows her aggressive, action-oriented approach to intimacy, comfortable with power exchange
- **Kyr4n**: Demonstrates his dominant nature when control is challenged, uses enhanced abilities without restraint, first crack in self-control of his inner darkness
- **Evilisa**: Encourages loss of control, validates his darker nature, possessive but satisfied that Zara "gets it," sees this as confirmation that he only needs his inner circle (and her)
- **Dynamic**: Clear power exchange with both characters getting what they need without emotional complications, but with longer effect

## Thematic Elements

- **Control and Surrender**: Both characters operating in their natural roles
- **Enhanced Abilities**: Kyr4n's strength and control used in intimate context
- **Mutual Understanding**: Both aware this is physical need, not romantic entanglement
- **Evilisa's Influence**: Her encouragement of his unrestrained nature, validation of violence/dominance as authentic self
- **Isolation Through Connection**: Even in intimacy with Zara, Kyr4n remains fundamentally alone with his manifestation

## Writing Notes

- All Evilisa dialogue in _italics_
- She only appears when Kyr4n is completely alone (before Zara arrives, after she leaves)
- Her tone shifts between encouraging and possessive
- She validates his loss of control as his "real self"
- She's satisfied Zara "understands" because it keeps him isolated from softer connections
