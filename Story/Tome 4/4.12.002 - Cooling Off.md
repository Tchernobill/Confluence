## 02:47 AM - Kyr4n's Private Quarters

The darkness in Kyr4n's quarters had settled into something almost peaceful. Emergency lighting cast long shadows across the room where Helene dozed on the couch, her medical tablet fallen to her chest, rising and falling with steady breaths. She'd volunteered for the first watch, insisting her medical training made her the logical choice if Kyr4n experienced any viral episodes.

Kyr4n sat at his desk, not working, just existing in the quiet. The electromagnetic signatures of the compound created a familiar symphony around him—sleeping bodies, humming electronics, the building's own electrical nervous system.

_Evilisa perched on the edge of his desk, legs swinging idly, watching him with something between affection and concern. "You should sleep," she said softly. "Even monsters need rest."_

Then, like a discordant note, three signatures approaching from the service corridor. Moving with purpose. Armed—he could feel the electronic components of their weapons, military-grade, nothing his people used.

_Evilisa's form snapped to attention, her playfulness evaporating. "Company," she hissed, already moving toward the door. "Three. Professional. This isn't random."_

"Didn't order pizza," he murmured to the darkness.

The signatures paused at the stairwell. Forty seconds until they reached his door. Maybe less.

_"The good doctor," Evilisa said, appearing beside Helene's sleeping form. "So loyal. So fragile. They'll kill her just for being here." Her fingers traced the air above Helene's face without touching. "Unless..."_

He moved silently to Helene, pulling a blanket from the back of the couch and draping it over her completely, tucking it to obscure her form. Her electromagnetic signature dimmed under the metallic-thread weave—a small protection, but perhaps enough.

_"How noble," Evilisa purred, but without her usual mockery. "Protecting her even now. But you know what comes next, don't you?" She moved to the far side of the room, beckoning. "Make noise. Draw them. Be the monster they're hunting."_

Then he crossed to the far side of the room, deliberately knocking over a chair. Draw attention. Make himself the only target.

The door exploded inward.

The flashbang that followed turned the world white and screaming. Even with his eyes closed, the light burned through his eyelids. The sound hit like a physical blow, setting every nerve firing. Helene didn't even stir under the blanket—unconscious before she could wake.

_Through the chaos, Evilisa remained perfectly clear, unaffected by the sensory assault. "Corporate military," she observed clinically. "Someone's been planning this. Someone who knows what you are."_

Kyr4n stumbled toward his desk, playing more disoriented than he was. Let them think the flashbang worked completely. Three figures in tactical gear swept in, weapons raised. Professional. Corporate.

_"That one," Evilisa pointed at the lead figure. "Anti-materiel rounds. They're not here to capture you." Her voice turned cold. "They're here to make sure you die."_

He was two feet from the desk when the first one fired.

The anti-materiel shotgun round hit him center mass—eight tungsten shards designed to punch through vehicle armor spreading through his torso. The impact threw him behind the desk, blood already pooling.

_Evilisa knelt beside him as he fell, her face showing genuine alarm for the first time. "No, no, no! Not like this!" She pressed her hands against his wounds, her touch electric but ineffective. "You're not done yet. You CAN'T be done yet!"_

The shooter advanced, firing twice more through the desk itself. The wood splintered, exploded, the rounds passing through to crater the wall behind.

Silence.

The three figures held position for thirty seconds. Forty. A full minute. Then, satisfied, they began to approach.

_"They think you're dead," Evilisa whispered, her form crackling with barely contained fury. "They think tungsten and tactics can stop what you've become." She stood, electricity arcing between her fingers. "Show them. Show them what happens when they threaten what's yours. SHOW THEM WHAT A MONSTER CAN DO!"_

The air changed.

It started as a feeling—static before a storm, hair standing on end, the taste of copper and ozone. The emergency lights flickered. Died. In the darkness, a sound like every circuit in the building clearing its throat at once.

_Evilisa threw her head back and screamed—not in fear but in savage joy. "YES! Let it build! Let it grow! They wanted the Technomancer? GIVE THEM THE TECHNOMANCER!"_

The lightning bolt that erupted from behind the ruined desk wasn't natural. It moved too slowly, branched too deliberately, seeking specific targets with intelligent purpose. It hit all three simultaneously, their tactical armor conducting the electricity directly into their bodies. The discharge lit the room like daylight for three impossible seconds.

_In that strobing light, Evilisa danced among the falling bodies, laughing with manic glee. "Beautiful! Perfect! This is what you are! This is what you were meant to be!"_

Then darkness again.

Minutes passed. Five. Ten. Finally, movement—wet, struggling, painful. Kyr4n crawled from behind the desk, leaving a dark trail across the floor. His shirt was ruined, the tungsten shards having torn through flesh and muscle. Blood soaked through, dripping steadily.

Two of the intruders were dead—he could feel their bioelectric signatures fading to nothing. The third was unconscious but alive, breathing shallow, nervous system scrambled but recoverable.

With effort that should have been impossible, Kyr4n stood. Swayed. Steadied. Then he bent and lifted the unconscious attacker in a fireman's carry, tungsten shards grinding against bone with every movement.

One foot in front of the other.

Out the destroyed door. Into the hallway, blood dripping a steady trail. To the stairwell. Up. Every step an agony, every breath wet and rattling.

The roof access door opened onto cold night air. His aircraft sat on the landing pad, sleek and silent. He loaded the unconscious figure into the passenger compartment with mechanical precision, then climbed into the pilot's seat.

The engine started with a thought—his electromagnetic interface overriding any security protocols. Pre-flight checks ignored. Safety systems disabled. Just up, away, into the dark.

## 02:58 AM - The Aftermath

Helene woke to the taste of copper and the smell of ozone. Her head pounded—flashbang hangover, her medical training supplied even through the disorientation. She pushed the blanket off, blinking in the darkness.

The room was destroyed. The door hung off its hinges. The desk was kindling. And the blood—

"Kyr4n?" Her voice came out cracked. Then louder: "Kyr4n!"

Two bodies in tactical gear. No, three—wait, two. Where was—

The blood trail led to the door.

Adrenaline hit like ice water. She lurched to her feet, following the red path. Hallway. Stairwell. Up—why up?

She burst onto the roof just as navigation lights disappeared into the darkness. The aircraft's signature fading into the night sky, already beyond visual range.

"No, no, no—"

Her earpiece crackled. Marcus's voice, alert and concerned: "Doc, we're getting reports of weapons discharge from the boss's floor. Three minutes ago, anti-materiel rounds detected. Kyr4n's not responding. What's your status?"

Helene stood at the roof's edge, wind whipping her hair, heart hammering. Below, she could already hear security teams mobilizing, confused voices, the first stages of panic. In minutes, the entire compound would know their leader was gone.

She forced her breathing to steady. Medical training taking over. Assess. Prioritize. Act.

"Marcus," she said, voice carrying artificial calm. "Full lockdown. Immediate. No one in or out."

"Doc, what's—"

"Three hostiles breached Kyr4n's quarters. Two dead on scene. Boss is..." She paused, choosing words carefully. "Boss pursued the third. Airborne. We need full security sweep, possible additional threats."

"Jesus Christ. Medical?"

"On my way down. Have a team secure the bodies—full hazmat protocols, these are corporate military. And Marcus?"

"Yeah?"

"Information blackout. No one outside the inner circle knows he's gone."

"Copy. Lockdown in effect."

Helene turned from the roof's edge, already running through scenarios, contingencies, medical probabilities. As she reached the stairwell, she noticed her bare feet were leaving their own prints now—not blood, but outlined in it, each step a red footprint in Kyr4n's trail.

She didn't stop. Couldn't stop. Somewhere in the night sky, their wounded leader flew toward an unknown destination with an enemy operative, bleeding from impossible wounds, driven by purposes she couldn't fathom.

Behind her, the compound erupted into controlled chaos—security teams deploying, medical units scrambling, the inner circle converging on a room painted with blood and lightning scars.

And in her pocket, Zara's voice came through the comm, steady despite the weight of the device she carried:

"Helene. Do we need to consider... the option?"

Helene looked at the blood on her feet, thought of the lightning that shouldn't exist, the tungsten shards that should have killed any normal human, the aircraft disappearing into darkness.

"Not yet," she said. "He's still Kyr4n. He took one alive. That means he wants answers."

"Or revenge."

"Then God help whoever sent them."

She reached the medical bay, her team already prepping trauma stations they might not need, for a patient who might never return.

In the distance, thunder rolled across a cloudless sky.
