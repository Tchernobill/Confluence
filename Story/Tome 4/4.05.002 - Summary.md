## Dialogue Highlights

**Aurelio on Terms:** "Rico's organization demanded forty percent of all Guild profits. In exchange, you received what he called 'protection'—primarily from his own enforcers... Phoenix Rising's proposal: twenty-five percent of profits—a fifteen percent reduction. But more importantly, we're offering actual value... Near-military grade protection with on-site security, twenty-minute response time on major threats, full access to Phoenix Rising Tier 1 and Tier 2 technologies, infrastructure hardening, professional training, and advanced weaponry at cost."

**Kyr4n's Mathematics:** "I'm offering better terms because they work better. For everyone. Twenty-five percent take, actual security services, technology access, community investment. Not out of altruism—though I won't pretend ethics aren't a factor—but because cooperative models generate better outcomes... That's not idealism. That's mathematics."

**Kyr4n's Philosophy:** "Greed is natural. It's hardwired into us, that instinct to take and hold and dominate. It resurfaces constantly because it's part of our evolutionary heritage. But greed keeps things stagnant. It's a closed loop, extraction without growth. Only cooperation moves us forward."

**Isa's Admission:** "I used to work with him. Before Phoenix Rising. Before he became... this. And I left. When he got infected with that military virus and started changing... I wasn't strong enough to watch what it was doing to him. The nightmares, the isolation, the way he pushed everyone away. So I left first... And walking down there means facing not just who he's become, but what I did when I left."

**Isa's Wariness:** "That's not the man I knew. The Kyr4n I worked with could barely handle a business negotiation without having an anxiety attack... This is someone who understands systems well enough to dismantle them. Who has the power to wipe out the Guild if we refuse his 'generous' offer."
