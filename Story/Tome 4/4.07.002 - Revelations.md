"There's something I need to tell you all."

The shift in his tone was subtle but unmistakable. The comfortable atmosphere didn't shatter, but it crystallized, everyone's attention focusing with the intensity of people who'd learned to recognize when things mattered.

"You all know I'm enhanced," he continued, setting down his water glass with deliberate care. "What you don't know is how, or why I've been so careful about medical scans." He glanced at Helen. "I imagine you've been curious about why I register as baseline human on every scan you've run."

Helen leaned forward slightly. "The thought had crossed my mind. Several times. Aggressively."

"Ten years ago, I was exposed to something during a corporate raid. A prototype weapon that should have killed me." He paused, gathering the words like weapons he was about to lay down. "I was infected with an early version of what the underground now calls DarkNight."

The silence that followed was absolute. Marcus had gone rigid, his hand unconsciously moving toward where his sidearm would normally rest. Alex's expression had sharpened to a blade's edge of focus. Jin's mouth had fallen open slightly, while Helen had gone pale enough that her freckles stood out like constellations.

"That's not—" Marcus started, then stopped. "DarkNight is just stories. Urban legend. Corporate boogeyman stuff."

"It's a myth," Jin added, though his voice lacked conviction. "Nano-viral torture system that traps you in personalized hell? That's conspiracy theory material."

"The medical implications alone," Helen whispered, her scientific mind racing past disbelief to implications. "A virus that could map and manipulate neural pathways in real-time... it would be the most sophisticated bioweapon ever created."

"It's real," Vyr4n said quietly. "Very real. And very much still inside me."

Alex leaned forward, his strategic mind already working through possibilities. "The psychological warfare applications would be... infinite. Complete neural mapping, fear response manipulation, memory access..." He paused. "You're saying you're actively carrying a DarkNight infection?"

"Not exactly." Vyr4n held out his hand, palm up. "What I carry now is something different. My friends Sedh and Mira found a way to interrupt the virus before it could complete its programming. They saved my life, but they couldn't remove it. So I did the only thing I could—I learned to control it."

Small arcs of electricity began dancing between his fingers, blue-white threads of energy that shouldn't have been possible with baseline human biology. The display was subtle, controlled, but undeniably real.

"I call it DayLight," he said with a self-deprecating smile. "Though most days it feels more like heavily overcast."

Jin was practically vibrating with excitement. "You turned DarkNight into an enhancement system? That's... that's impossible. That's like turning a nuclear bomb into a power plant while it's exploding."

"More like turning a torture device into a tool," Vyr4n corrected. "And it wasn't easy. The virus still wants to do what it was designed for. Every day is a negotiation between what it wants and what I need."

Zara, who had been silent throughout the revelation, finally spoke. "How much does it hurt?"

The question cut straight to the heart of it, bypassing the technical marvel to the human cost. Vyr4n met her eyes, seeing understanding there that the others might miss.

"Every day," he admitted. "It's manageable, but it's always there. Like background noise made of broken glass."

"The bioelectric sensitivity," Helen said suddenly, pieces clicking into place. "You can sense electrical fields. That's how you always know when someone's augments are malfunctioning. How you knew about my neural implant before I told anyone."

"Among other things," Vyr4n confirmed. "The nanobots interface with my nervous system in ways that give me... abilities. Enhanced healing, reflexes, strength. The electromagnetic manipulation you just saw. And yes, sensitivity to bioelectric fields."

"Which means you can tell when someone's lying," Alex stated rather than asked. "Read their stress responses, heart rate changes, neural activity spikes."

"To an extent."

Kaia suddenly moved from the arm of his chair to face him directly, her wine-hazed eyes sharpening with intensity. "Can you read minds?"

It was the question he'd been dreading, the fear that lived at the heart of all his secrets. "That's the question I was afraid you'd ask."

He stood, needing movement to get through this. "Reading someone's bioelectric signature is like... imagine looking at someone and trying not to notice what color shirt they're wearing. It's there, it's obvious, and actively ignoring it takes effort. But actual thoughts, memories, the content of someone's mind—that's different. It's possible, theoretically. The nanobots could create that kind of interface. But it would require dedicated effort, time, and..." he paused, "it would make me exactly the monster people think DarkNight creates."

"So you've never done it?" Alex pressed.

Vyr4n was quiet for a moment, then: "Once. In the interrogation room with Wells. It was necessary to get the information we needed. And I still feel sick about it."

"Wells," Zara said softly. "The dancing."

"A cover," Vyr4n confirmed. "Made it look like psychological manipulation instead of direct neural interface. Less terrifying for everyone involved, including me."

"But you got the information," Marcus said, his pragmatic nature cutting through to results.

"I did. And I hated every second of it." Vyr4n turned to face them all. "Which brings me to why I'm telling you this now. You deserve to know what you're really working with. Who you're trusting your lives to."

He moved to the center of the room, ensuring he could see all of them. For a moment, he was silent, gathering himself for what came next.

"You want to know what it's really like?" His voice was calm, almost conversational. "Living with DarkNight?"

Alex leaned forward. "Could the enhancements be transferred to others? Could we—"

"Ever wonder what it's like to sense everything?" Vyr4n interrupted, his tone remaining eerily measured.

The room went still.

"There's power in connection," he continued, holding out his hand as small arcs of electricity danced between his fingers. "Every circuit, every heartbeat, every bioelectric pulse—they all speak to you. Like the world finally decided to share its secrets and you learned to listen. You reach into systems others can't even see. The impossible becomes... simple."

The electricity died. His hand dropped.

"But then, there's this noise."

He tapped his temple.

"In your head. And it never. Stops."

Each word was its own sentence, its own weight.

"Every device screaming its function. Every person's signature burning into your awareness. Can't filter it. Can't turn it off. Can't close your eyes and find silence because silence stopped existing the moment this thing rewrote my nervous system."

Helen's medical scanner had appeared in her hand, though she wasn't using it. Just holding it, like an anchor.

"And these abilities?" Vyr4n's voice remained devastatingly calm. "They don't ask permission. They just activate. Mid-conversation. Mid-touch. Always half a second from hurting someone who matters. Living in constant fear that the thing you can't control will do something you can't take back."

He paused, looking at each of them in turn.

"Worst part?"

The question hung in the air like a blade.

"This thing inside me—it thinks. Or I think. I honestly can't tell anymore. Is that my thought or is it suggesting? Am I making choices or just... agreeing with something I can't quite hear? When did the line disappear?"

Jin had gone very pale. "Vyr4n..."

"You asked if it could be transferred." He looked directly at Alex. "It's funny. Most people fear losing themselves. I fear I already have. I watch myself exist from somewhere outside my body. Going through motions. Performing humanity. I don't feel real anymore. Don't feel truly present. Just... aware. Of everything and nothing."

The silence that followed was absolute.

"I don't remember what silence feels like," he said, almost to himself. "I don't remember being certain I exist."

Then, with that same terrible calm: "That's what you're asking for."

Alex slowly shook his head. "I... I didn't understand."

"No one does," Marcus said quietly, surprising everyone. "That's the point. We see the power, the abilities, the advantage. We don't see the cost."

"It doesn't change who you are," Helen said firmly, though her voice shook slightly. "Depression, depersonalization, sensory overload—these are symptoms, not identity. You're still you, even if you can't always feel it."

"Am I?" Vyr4n asked, and for the first time, uncertainty crept into his voice. "Or am I just something that remembers being human?"

"You're the man who just trusted us with this," Jin said with forced lightness, though his eyes were serious. "That's pretty human to me."

Helen stood and walked over to him, medical scanner in hand. "May I? Now that I know what I'm looking at..."

Vyr4n nodded, and she ran the scanner over him, watching the readouts with fascination. "Incredible. The integration is perfect. The nanobots aren't just in your bloodstream, they're woven into your neural tissue, your muscle fibers... You're a living hybrid of organic and synthetic systems."

"Less impressive when you realize it means any strong EMP would probably kill me," Vyr4n said dryly.

"We need to control the narrative around this," Kaia said, her intelligence handler instincts kicking in despite the wine. "If anyone finds out you're carrying functioning DarkNight tech..."

"They'd either try to extract it or destroy me," Vyr4n finished. "I know. That's why it stays in this room."

"What do we tell people about your abilities?" Alex asked.

"Military enhancement gone wrong," Marcus suggested. "Close enough to truth, vague enough to avoid questions."

"People fear what they don't understand," Zara added. "DarkNight terrifies everyone. But military augmentation? That's just another Tuesday in the slums."
