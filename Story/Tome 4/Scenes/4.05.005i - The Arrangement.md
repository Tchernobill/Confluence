## The Scene

The training session had drawn a larger audience than usual. Word had spread that Zara was pushing their boss harder in combat drills, and the security team found reasons to linger near the observation windows.

_Oh good. An audience. How professional._

Kyr4n didn't acknowledge the whisper at the edge of his consciousness, that familiar bitter presence that only existed when others couldn't see. He kept his eyes on Zara as she circled him on the mat.

"Again," he said, his voice carrying to the observers. "You're telegraphing the knife hand."

Zara adjusted her grip on the training blade, eyes tracking his movement. She lunged forward, the blade cutting air where his ribs had been a millisecond before. He caught her wrist, used her momentum to spin her around, pressing her back against his chest with the blade trapped between them.

_So close. She's always so close now. Touching. Taking._

She drove her elbow back, forcing him to release her. When he chose release, she spun to face him, lips pulled back in something between smile and snarl.

The next exchange was faster, more brutal. His enhanced reflexes let him flow around her attacks while his hands found pressure points. But she adapted, getting inside his guard, her palm striking toward his throat before he caught it inches away.

Their faces were close enough that she could smell the salt of his sweat, feel the heat radiating from his skin. She twisted in his grip, bringing her knee up toward his ribs. He blocked with his free hand, but the motion pressed their bodies together—her breasts flattening against his chest through the thin fabric of her sports bra.

_Look at her. Pressing against you in front of everyone. Marking her territory._

The observers couldn't hear words, but they could see the tension, the way neither fighter was pulling punches. What they couldn't see was how Zara's pupils dilated when his hand wrapped around her throat in a control hold, or how his cock stirred against her hip when she pressed against him during close grappling.

She pulled back, wiping sweat from her forehead, then dropped into a fighting stance. But the look in her eyes had nothing to do with combat training.

_She's going to push again. She always pushes._

The next takedown was fast enough that the observers missed the transition. One moment they were circling each other, the next Zara was on her back with Kyr4n's full weight pinning her to the mat, his forearm across her throat with just enough pressure to make breathing interesting.

Her struggles were real, but so was the way her back arched slightly beneath him, pressing her pussy against his thigh through their workout clothes. The catch in her breathing wasn't just from the pressure on her windpipe.

_There it is. That look. She wants more than training._

He held the position for five more seconds before releasing her, stepping back to offer a hand up. When she took it, her fingers raked across his palm—deliberate contact that sent heat shooting through both of them.

"That's enough for today," he announced to the room.

The observers filed out. Marcus lingered near the door, but a look from Kyr4n sent him following the others.

_Finally. Now let's see what she really wants._

When they were alone, Zara gathered her gear without speaking. At the door, she paused, looked back at him, then ran her tongue across her lower lip before disappearing into the corridor.

_She's coming to you again. Can't stay away, can she?_

Twenty minutes later, Kyr4n stood under the rainfall shower in his private quarters, hot water cascading over his shoulders and down his back. The bathroom filled with steam that carried the scent of soap and exhaustion.

He'd felt her approach long before the bathroom door opened—the subtle electromagnetic signature of her enhanced reflexes, the vibration of her footsteps through the floor.

_Here she comes. Your persistent little predator._

He didn't turn around when the shower door slid open behind him.

Zara stepped into the shower space, still fully clothed, water immediately soaking through her training gear. No words. The wet fabric clung to every curve—her tits outlined clearly through the sports bra, the material of her pants molding to the shape of her ass.

_No hesitation. No asking. Just taking again._

Her hands went to the hem of her soaked shirt, peeling it off with practiced efficiency. The sports bra followed, freeing her breasts—medium-sized, perfectly proportioned, nipples already hard from the cool air before the hot water hit them. Then the training pants, revealing the dark triangle between her legs, the strong muscles of her thighs.

She pressed against his back, her breasts flattening against his shoulders, nipples hard points against his skin. Her hands slid around his waist, one moving lower to wrap around his cock. He was already hardening, had been since she'd pressed against him on the training mat.

_Of course you're hard for her. Of course._

When he turned to face her, she was already stroking him with confident familiarity—firm grip, twisting motion that made his breath hitch. Water ran in rivulets down her dark skin, pooling in the hollow of her throat, streaming between her breasts.

She stepped closer, pressing her body against his, guiding his hand between her legs. Wet heat that had nothing to do with the shower, slick lips parted and ready. The musky scent of her arousal mixed with the steam around them.

"Lose control," she whispered against his mouth, the first words either had spoken. "Stop holding back."

_She wants the monster. Does she even know what she's asking for?_

Her head fell back under the shower spray, exposing the long line of her throat. His hand tangled in her wet hair, pulling her head back further. She made a sound—half growl, half moan—and wrapped her legs around his waist as he lifted her.

The stone wall was cool against her back despite the hot water. When he entered her, it was with the same controlled force he'd used during training—his cock stretching her, filling her completely. Her pussy gripped him tight, wet and hot around his length.

_There. That's better. Use her._

She bit his shoulder, nails digging into his back, leaving marks that would fade within hours thanks to his enhanced healing. Her body moved against his with desperate efficiency, taking everything he gave and demanding more through the arch of her spine, the way her cunt clenched around him.

"More," she gasped against his ear. "Let go. Fucking lose it."

_Yes. Show her. Show her what you really are._

He pressed her harder against the wall, moved faster, let more of his enhanced strength show. The sound of skin slapping against skin echoed off the stone walls, mixed with their harsh breathing and the steady rush of water.

After several minutes, she pushed at his chest. "Turn me around."

He pulled out of her, letting her legs drop to the floor. She immediately turned to face the wall, pressing her palms flat against the wet stone, looking back at him over her shoulder with eyes dark with lust.

_Look at her offering herself. She really thinks she can handle you._

The sight of her bent over, water streaming down her spine, ass raised and waiting—it shattered something in his carefully maintained control. His hands gripped her hips, and when he pressed against her, it wasn't against her pussy.

The blunt head of his cock pushed against her tighter entrance, and she tensed for a moment before forcing herself to relax. "Fuck," she hissed. "Hmm!"

_Oh, this is new. Breaking new ground, are we?_

When he entered her ass, it was slowly at first, letting her body adjust to the stretch. The sensation was overwhelming—tighter than her pussy, the feeling of complete possession as he filled her completely.

"Haa," she breathed, her voice strained but eager. "Deeper."

This angle let him go deeper, hit spots that made her cry out in ways that were equal parts pleasure and intensity. His hands gripped her hips, fingers digging into the soft flesh hard enough to bruise. The sound she made was purely animal—no words, just the expression of hunger being fed.

"Yes," she hissed, pushing back against each thrust. "Like that. Don't stop."

_Harder. She wants it harder. Give it to her._

He put his hands on the tiles facing her, pushing against the wall. Her teeth found his earlobe when he leaned over her, biting hard enough to make him growl. The sensation, combined with the way she looked back at him with absolute confidence that she could handle whatever he gave her, finally broke his control completely.

_Yes! There he is! My beautiful monster!_

His climax hit with devastating intensity—a complete surrender of the careful restraint he maintained everywhere else. His hands pressed flat against the shower wall on either side of her head as his cock pulsed inside her ass, his enhanced body shuddering with the force of release.

The sound of cracking ceramic cut through the rush of water.

_Oh._

Zara's eyes went wide as she looked up at his hands. Two tiles had spider-webbed under his grip, hairline fractures spreading outward from where his palms had pressed. Small pieces of ceramic fell to the shower floor with sharp clicking sounds.

"Jesus Christ," she breathed, staring at the damage.

_No. No, wait—_

Kyr4n pulled out of her immediately, stumbling backward as the implications hit him. His legs gave out and he slumped to the shower floor, back against the wall, water streaming over his head and shoulders. His heart hammered against his ribs, enhanced metabolism working to process the sudden flood of neurochemicals and adrenaline.

"I could have—" He stared at his hands, then at her, horror replacing the satisfaction of moments before. "If those had been your hips..."

_Damn it. He's shutting down again._

Zara turned around slowly, studying the fractured tiles, then his face. The dangerous excitement in her eyes flickered, replaced by something more complex—understanding mixed with genuine concern.

But beneath that, something else stirred. A cold realization creeping through her post-orgasmic haze.

She'd pushed for this. Demanded it. "Lose control," she'd said. "Fucking lose it."

And he had. And it could have killed her.

"But they weren't," she said quietly, lowering herself to sit beside him on the wet tiles.

"This time." His hands were shaking now, and she noticed. "When I lose control like that... when I let the enhancements take over completely..." He gestured at the broken tiles. "I could hurt you. Really hurt you. Without meaning to."

_It's not your fault. She pushed you to this. She wanted it._

She studied his profile, seeing the genuine fear beneath his usual composure. The horror at what he'd almost done. "But you didn't."

"This time." His voice carried the weight of someone who'd just realized exactly how close he'd come to disaster. "My grip strength when fully enhanced could crack bones. Crush them. And I was too far gone to notice until it was too late."

The words hit her like physical blows. Too far gone. Because she'd pushed him. Because she'd demanded he lose control, knowing—or should have known—what that meant for someone with his abilities.

What kind of person did that?

"So you hold back. Always."

"I have to." He looked at her directly. "You don't understand what it's like, having that much physical capability and knowing that one moment of lost control could..."

He didn't finish, but she understood. The responsibility of being permanently dangerous, permanently careful, permanently restrained.

And she'd demanded he abandon all of that. For what? Her pleasure? Her need to feel... what, exactly?

_This is getting tedious. He's fine, you're fine, everyone's fine._

"Shit," she said quietly, but the word felt inadequate. Hollow.

She'd pushed him past his own safety protocols. Past the careful control that kept people alive around him. Because some fucked up part of her wanted—what? To see how far he'd go? To test his limits? To force him to show his real nature?

What the fuck was wrong with her?

"Zara?" His voice cut through her spiraling thoughts. "Are you—"

"I have to go."

She stood abruptly, water streaming off her skin. Her movements were efficient, automatic, as she stepped out of the shower.

_Oh, she's running now. Finally._

"Zara, wait—"

"I'm fine." The lie tasted like copper in her mouth. She grabbed a towel without looking at him, wrapping it around herself with shaking hands. "I just... I need to go."

"You're not fine. Talk to me—"

"I can't." The words came out sharper than she intended. "I just... I need to think."

She could feel his eyes on her as she moved toward the door, but she couldn't look back. Couldn't face the concern in his expression when she was the one who'd pushed him to this. When she was the one with something broken inside that made her demand he lose control, made her excited by the danger, made her—

The bathroom door closed behind her, cutting off whatever he was saying.

_Just us again. She'll come crawling back eventually. They always do._

She dressed quickly in the bedroom, fingers fumbling with her clothes. Her training gear was still soaked, abandoned in his shower, but she didn't care. She pulled on the casual clothes she'd left here earlier—when had she started leaving clothes in his quarters?—and headed for the door.

Behind her, she could still hear the shower running. Could imagine him sitting there on the wet tiles, alone with his fear and his shaking hands and the cracked evidence of what she'd made him do.

What kind of person sought out that level of danger? What kind of person pushed someone past their own safety limits? What kind of person felt that rush of excitement when they saw the tiles crack, when they realized just how close they'd come to—

She made it to her own quarters before her legs gave out.

Back in the shower, Kyr4n sat on the cooling tiles, water still streaming over his shoulders. His hands had stopped shaking, but the horror hadn't faded.

_She left you. Just like I said she would._

He looked up at the phantom figure now visible in the steam—Evilisa, her electric eyes bright with something that wasn't quite satisfaction, not quite disappointment.

_Though I have to admit..._ She moved closer, her form becoming more solid as his isolation deepened. _Watching you crack those tiles? Watching you finally let the monster out, even for just a moment?_

Her smile widened, sharp and cruel.

_That was beautiful. My beautiful, dangerous boy. That's what you really are under all that careful control. That's what I see. What she wanted to see, until she actually saw it._

"She's not coming back."

_Probably not. Not after that._ The hallucination knelt beside him, and he could almost feel her phantom touch against his cheek. _But maybe that's for the best. She pushed you too far. Made you dangerous. I told you she'd realize eventually what you are._

"What I am," he repeated hollowly.

_A monster. My monster. And isn't it better to be that with someone who actually wants you that way? Someone who won't run when they see what you're capable of?_

"You're not real."

_I'm real enough. And I'm still here. That's more than I can say for her._ Her voice dropped to an intimate whisper. _I'm always here. The only constant you have. The only one who sees your beautiful, terrible nature and doesn't flinch._

He closed his eyes, letting the water wash over him, alone except for the phantom presence that fed on his isolation.

_Just us,_ she whispered. _Like it should be._

The water ran cold before he finally stood to turn it off, leaving him shivering in the silence with only cracked tiles and the ghost of Evilisa's laughter for company.
