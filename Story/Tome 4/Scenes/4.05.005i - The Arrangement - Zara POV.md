## The Arrangement - Zara's POV

The training room was more crowded than usual. Zara felt eyes on them from the observation windows—security team members who'd found excuses to linger, to watch. Good. Let them wonder. Let them see their boss getting pushed hard enough to sweat.

She circled him on the mat, training blade loose in her grip. His eyes tracked her movement with that predatory focus she'd learned to read. Always calculating. Always three moves ahead.

"Again," Kyr4n said. "You're telegraphing the knife hand."

She adjusted her grip, watching for the opening. There—the slightest shift in his weight. She lunged forward, blade cutting air where his ribs had been a heartbeat before. Fast. But he was faster.

His hand caught her wrist mid-strike, used her own momentum to spin her around. Suddenly she was pressed back against his chest, blade trapped between them, his body heat radiating through her sports bra.

Professional. This is supposed to be professional.

She drove her elbow back, forcing him to release her. The moment his grip loosened, she spun to face him, couldn't quite suppress the smile that pulled at her lips. That rush—the challenge of trying to land a hit on someone who moved like water around her attacks.

The next exchange was faster, more brutal. She knew the observers couldn't see the way his fingers found pressure points with surgical precision, how she adapted to get inside his guard, how their bodies moved closer with each strike until she could smell the salt of his sweat.

Her palm shot toward his throat. He caught it inches away, and for a moment they were frozen—his hand wrapped around her wrist, their faces close enough that she could see the dark flecks in his eyes, feel his breath against her skin.

She twisted in his grip, bringing her knee up toward his ribs. He blocked, but the motion pressed their bodies together—her breasts flattening against his chest through the thin fabric. The contact sent heat shooting through her that had nothing to do with combat training.

Focus. You're being watched.

But she didn't want to focus. She wanted—

She pulled back, wiping sweat from her forehead with deliberate slowness. When she dropped back into fighting stance, she knew the look in her eyes had shifted. Knew he'd see it. Good.

The next takedown came fast. One moment they were circling, the next her back hit the mat with Kyr4n's full weight pinning her down, his forearm across her throat with just enough pressure to make breathing interesting.

She struggled—genuine resistance against his superior strength—but her back arched slightly beneath him, pressing her pussy against his thigh through their workout clothes. The pressure sent a spike of arousal through her that made her breath catch, and not from the arm against her windpipe.

His eyes flickered—recognition. He knew exactly what he was doing to her, and she loved that he knew.

He held the position five more seconds. Five seconds of delicious pressure, of being pinned, of surrender that felt like victory. When he released her and offered his hand, she took it, deliberately raking her fingers across his palm as he pulled her up.

The contact was electric. Direct communication: _This isn't over._

"That's enough for today," he announced to the room.

The observers filed out slowly, reluctantly. Marcus lingered near the door, but one look from Kyr4n sent him following the others. When they were alone, Zara gathered her gear without speaking. Words would ruin it.

At the door, she paused. Looked back. Let her tongue trace across her lower lip—a promise, an invitation—then disappeared into the corridor.

Twenty minutes. Give him twenty minutes to shower, to think she might not come, to wonder.

She spent those minutes in her quarters, heart racing, skin flushed. Changed out of her training gear into fresh clothes she'd immediately discard. The anticipation was its own kind of pleasure—knowing what was coming, knowing he knew, neither of them saying it out loud.

When she finally made her way to his private quarters, her fingers were steady on the access panel. He'd given her the code weeks ago—practical necessity for his bodyguard. But this wasn't about security.

She could hear the shower running as she let herself in. Steam escaped from the partially open bathroom door. She moved through his quarters silently—old habits from her assassination days—and paused at the bathroom entrance.

Through the steam, she could see his silhouette under the rainfall shower. Water cascading over his shoulders, down his back. Lean muscle, perfect control even in something as simple as bathing.

She wanted to shatter that control.

No words. Words would give him a chance to think, to retreat behind that careful mask he wore. She stepped into the shower fully clothed, water immediately soaking through her clothes.

His body tensed—awareness of her presence—but he didn't turn around. Waiting. Always so goddamn controlled.

The wet fabric clung to her skin as she peeled off her shirt, dropped it to the shower floor. The sports bra followed. Cool air hit her nipples before the hot water found them, making them harden. She shed her pants, underwear, until there was nothing between them but steam and intention.

She pressed against his back, her breasts flattening against his shoulders, and reached around to wrap her hand around his cock. Already hardening. Good. He wanted this as much as she did.

When he turned to face her, she was already stroking him—firm grip, twisting motion she'd learned he liked. His breath hitched. That small loss of control sent satisfaction through her like a drug.

She pressed closer, guiding his hand between her legs. Wet heat that had nothing to do with the shower, slick and ready. The musky scent of her own arousal mixed with steam.

"Lose control," she whispered against his mouth. The first words either had spoken. "Stop holding back."

She let her head fall back under the spray, exposing her throat. Submission. Trust. _Take what you want._

His hand tangled in her wet hair, pulling her head back further. Yes. The sharp sting of her scalp, the exposure of her throat, the way he looked at her like she was something he wanted to consume—this was what she needed.

She wrapped her legs around his waist as he lifted her, the stone wall cool against her back despite the hot water. When he entered her, it was with that controlled force he brought to everything—precise, powerful, overwhelming.

Perfect.

She bit his shoulder, nails digging into his back, marking him the way he was marking her. Her body moved against his with desperate efficiency, chasing the sensation of being filled, used, dominated by someone who could actually handle her aggression.

"More," she gasped against his ear. "Let go. Fucking lose it."

She felt him press harder against the wall, move faster. Felt more of his enhanced strength coming through. Yes. This was what she wanted—to push him past his careful control, to see what he really was underneath all that restraint.

After several minutes, the angle wasn't enough. "Turn me around."

He pulled out, letting her legs drop. She immediately turned to face the wall, pressing her palms flat against wet stone, looking back at him over her shoulder with undisguised hunger.

Come on. Stop holding back. Show me.

The sight of her bent over, waiting, offering—she saw something shift in his eyes. Something darker. Rawer. The monster peeking through.

His hands gripped her hips, and when he pressed against her, it wasn't where she expected.

The blunt head of his cock pushed against her ass, and she tensed instinctively before forcing herself to relax. New territory. Higher stakes. Exactly what she wanted.

"Fuck," she hissed as he pressed forward. "Hmm!"

The stretch was intense—more than she'd expected, but not more than she could handle. Pain and pleasure blurring together as he entered her slowly, giving her body time to adjust.

"Haa," she breathed when he was fully inside. The feeling of complete possession, of being filled in a way that left no room for anything else. "Deeper."

He obliged. The new angle let him hit spots that made her cry out—sounds that were equal parts pleasure and intensity and triumph. His hands gripped her hips hard enough to bruise, and she loved it. Evidence. Proof she could push him this far.

"Yes," she hissed, pushing back against each thrust. "Like that. Don't stop."

She felt him lean forward, his hands moving to the tiles on either side of her. Supporting himself. Losing himself in the rhythm, in the sensation, in her.

She twisted her head to bite his earlobe when he leaned close, tasting salt and satisfaction. The way he growled in response—pure animal—told her she'd won. He was finally letting go.

_This is it. This is what I wanted. To break through that control. To see what he really is._

His rhythm became more erratic, less precise. His breathing harsh against her ear. She looked back at him and saw his face—lost in sensation, control shattering, beautiful in his abandon.

"That's it," she whispered. "Let it out."

He did.

His climax hit with devastating force—his whole body shuddering, a sound escaping his throat that was more animal than human. His hands pressed flat against the shower wall on either side of her head, supporting his weight as he came inside her.

And then—

_CRACK._

The sound cut through the rush of water, sharp and final.

She looked up and went still.

Spider-web fractures spread across two tiles under his palms, hairline cracks radiating outward from where his hands pressed. Small pieces of ceramic fell to the shower floor with soft clicking sounds that seemed impossibly loud.

The satisfaction drained from her like water down a drain.

He pulled out immediately, stumbling backward. His legs gave out and he slumped to the shower floor, back against the wall. Water streamed over him as he stared at his hands with naked horror.

"I could have—" His voice was rough, broken. He looked at his hands, then at her. "If those had been your hips..."

The words hit her like a physical blow.

Her hips. Where his hands had been gripping moments ago. Where he could have—

She turned slowly, studying the fractured tiles. The damage. The evidence of exactly how much force he'd been applying. How much strength he possessed that he constantly, carefully, perpetually held back.

Except he hadn't held back. Not completely. Not this time.

_Because I told him not to._

"But they weren't," she said, the words automatic. She lowered herself to sit beside him, shoulder touching his, because she didn't know what else to do.

"This time." His hands were shaking. "When I lose control like that... when I let the enhancements take over completely..." He gestured at the broken tiles. "I could hurt you. Really hurt you. Without meaning to."

She watched him process it—the horror, the fear, the weight of being permanently dangerous. Watched him realize exactly how close he'd come.

_How close I pushed him._

"But you didn't," she said again, quieter.

"This time." His voice carried the weight of someone who'd just had a nightmare become real. "My grip strength when fully enhanced could crack bones. Crush them. And I was too far gone to notice until it was too late."

_Too far gone._

The words echoed in her head. Too far gone to notice. Too far gone to stop. Too far gone to control what he was doing to her body.

Because she'd told him to lose control.

She'd demanded it. "Lose control," she'd said. "Fucking lose it."

And he had. And it could have killed her.

Something cold settled in her stomach.

"So you hold back. Always."

"I have to." He looked at her directly, and she saw the genuine fear in his eyes. "You don't understand what it's like, having that much physical capability and knowing that one moment of lost control could..."

But she did understand. She understood perfectly.

She understood that he'd been holding back during every training session, every fight, every moment of physical contact. That his careful control wasn't just personality—it was survival. For him and everyone around him.

And she'd pushed him to abandon it.

_What kind of person does that?_

"Shit," she said quietly, the word feeling grossly inadequate.

She looked at the cracked tiles again. Evidence of what could have happened. What almost happened. What she'd demanded happen by pushing him past his safety limits.

She'd wanted to see the monster. Wanted to break through his control. Wanted to test how far he'd go.

And she'd succeeded. And the monster was strong enough to crush bones without thinking. Strong enough to kill without meaning to. And she'd told him to stop holding back.

_"Lose control," I said. Like it was safe. Like there were no consequences._

The cold feeling in her stomach was spreading. Not fear of him—something worse. Fear of herself. Of what it meant that she'd wanted this. That she'd pushed for it. That some fucked up part of her had been excited by the danger.

What was wrong with her?

"Zara?" His voice cut through her spiraling thoughts. "Are you—"

"I have to go."

The words came out before she could think them through. She stood abruptly, water streaming off her skin, and stepped out of the shower.

"Zara, wait—"

"I'm fine." The lie was automatic, meaningless. She grabbed a towel, wrapping it around herself with hands that weren't quite steady. "I just... I need to go."

"You're not fine. Talk to me—"

"I can't." The words came out sharper than she intended. She couldn't look at him—couldn't face the concern in his eyes when she was the one who'd pushed him to this. "I just... I need to think."

She could feel his gaze on her back as she moved toward the door, but she didn't turn around. Couldn't. Because if she looked at him sitting there on the shower floor with horror in his eyes and shaking hands, she'd have to confront what she'd done.

What kind of person demanded someone abandon the control that kept people alive? What kind of person got excited by danger? What kind of person pushed and pushed until—

She grabbed her soaked training clothes from the shower floor and carried them out, not bothering to dress. In the bedroom, she found the casual clothes she'd left here earlier—_when did I start leaving clothes in his quarters?_—and pulled them on with fumbling fingers.

Behind her, the shower was still running. She could imagine him sitting there, alone with his fear and his shaking hands and the evidence of what she'd made him do.

_Made him do._

No. He'd chosen to. But she'd pushed. She'd demanded. She'd told him to lose control, and he'd hesitated, and she'd pushed harder—

"More," she'd said. "Let go. Fucking lose it."

Her stomach churned.

She headed for the door, each step feeling mechanical. Wrong. Everything about this was wrong—not just what happened in the shower, but her need to push him there in the first place.

What did it say about her that she'd wanted to see him lose control? That she'd been excited by the risk? That even now, some dark part of her was satisfied she'd gotten exactly what she wanted?

She'd seen the monster. She'd felt its strength. She'd pushed it to emerge.

And it could have killed her.

_And I wanted it._

The door to his quarters closed behind her with a soft click that sounded final. She stood in the corridor for a moment, breathing hard, trying to process what had just happened.

Behind that door, he was probably still sitting on the shower floor. Alone with his horror. Alone with the realization of what he'd almost done.

Because of her.

She needed to move. Needed to get back to her quarters before someone saw her like this—disheveled, shaken, face probably showing too much.

Her legs carried her through the corridors on autopilot. Past the security checkpoints. Past the common areas. Past Marcus's quarters where light showed under the door—she didn't want to talk to anyone, couldn't talk to anyone about this.

When she finally made it to her own quarters and the door sealed behind her, her legs gave out.

She slid down the wall, knees pulled to her chest, towel-dried hair still damp and tangled.

She should be frightened of him. Should be backing away from someone with that much deadly capability. Should be reconsidering her role as his bodyguard if she couldn't trust him to control his strength.

But she wasn't frightened of him.

She was frightened of herself.

Because she'd wanted it. Had actively sought it out. Had pushed past his hesitation and his careful control to force out the dangerous, violent, monstrous thing he kept locked away.

_What's wrong with me?_

She pressed her palms against her eyes, but she could still see the cracked tiles. Could still hear the sound they made breaking. Could still imagine what that force would have done to her hips, her ribs, her skull.

Should have died. Could have died. Would have died if his control had slipped just a few inches to the left.

And she'd demanded he let it slip.

She'd bit his earlobe. Told him not to stop. Pushed back against him, encouraging more force, more intensity, more loss of control.

_I wanted him to hurt me._

No. That wasn't quite right. She wanted... what? To test him? To prove she could handle whatever he was? To force him to show his real nature?

To feel something intense enough to quiet the constant vigilance in her own head?

She didn't know. That was the problem. She didn't understand her own psychology. Didn't understand why she needed this particular kind of danger, this particular kind of surrender to overwhelming force.

Normal people didn't do this. Normal people didn't push dangerous men past their safety limits. Normal people didn't get excited by the possibility of being hurt.

But she wasn't normal. Had never been normal. Refugee camps didn't create normal people. Assassination training didn't create normal people. Years of violence and survival and using her body as a weapon didn't create normal people.

But she'd thought she understood herself. Thought she knew what she was—a survivor, a fighter, someone who'd chosen to be the weapon rather than the victim.

Now she wasn't sure.

Because victims didn't seek out danger. Didn't demand their protectors hurt them. Didn't get excited by the breaking point between control and violence.

So what did that make her?

She sat there on the floor of her quarters for a long time, trying to answer that question. Trying to understand what was broken inside her that made her need this. Made her push for it. Made her willing to die for it.

The tiles had cracked. She should have died. And some part of her had loved it.

_I need to understand. I need to know what's wrong with me._

But she couldn't figure it out alone. Couldn't untangle her own psychology from the inside. Needed someone who could see into her head, show her what was really driving this self-destructive need for danger and dominance and pain.

Needed someone who could read minds.

Or close enough.

She knew what she had to ask him. Knew it would cross a line that couldn't be uncrossed. Knew it was dangerous in a completely different way than physical violence.

But she needed to understand.

_I need you to show me what's inside my head. I need to see what I really am._

The thought terrified her more than the cracked tiles had.

But she knew, with absolute certainty, that she was going to ask him anyway.
