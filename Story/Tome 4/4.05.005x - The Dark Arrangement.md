## The Monster's Reward

The water had run cold before he finally stood to turn it off. Kyr4n's hands were steadier now, but the horror hadn't faded. The cracked tiles mocked him from the wall—evidence of exactly how close he'd come to catastrophe.

_Just us,_ Evilisa whispered. _Like it should be._

He dried himself mechanically, trying to ignore the phantom presence that had grown more solid since Zara's departure. The towel felt rough against his skin, still sensitive from the intense encounter. His body was exhausted, but his mind wouldn't quiet.

"You need to leave," he said to the empty bathroom, knowing it was futile.

_Leave?_ Her laughter was soft, intimate. _I can't leave, Kyr4n. I'm part of you. And besides..._ She moved closer, her form becoming more substantial in the mirror's reflection. _Why would I leave now? When you finally let me see him?_

"Him?"

_Your beautiful monster._ She smiled, sharp and hungry. _The thing you keep locked away. The predator. The killer. The one who cracks tiles and could crush bones without thinking._

"That's not—"

_Don't lie to me. I was there. I felt it._ Her eyes gleamed electric-bright. _You let him out, just for a moment. And it was glorious._

He turned away from the mirror, wrapping the towel around his waist. "She left because of that. Because I—"

_Because she couldn't handle what you are. But I can._ Evilisa's voice dropped to something darker, more seductive. _I've been handling it for years. Watching. Waiting. Wanting._

"You're not real." The words felt hollow even as he said them.

_Real enough._

And then he felt it.

A touch. Real as anything—fingers trailing down his spine, making his breath catch. Not imagination. Not suggestion. Actual sensation registering in his nervous system, as real as Zara's touch had been minutes ago.

He spun around, but saw only the phantom figure, closer now, her hand extended as if she'd actually touched him.

"What did you—"

_I've always been able to do this._ Her smile widened. _Your virus-enhanced nervous system, your modified neural pathways—they're not just yours anymore. They're ours. I can make you feel... anything._

Her hand moved again, and he felt it—phantom fingers brushing across his chest, following the path water had taken moments before. The sensation was impossible but undeniable. His body responded despite his horror.

"Stop."

_Why?_ She moved closer, and he could almost smell her—that electric scent like ozone and old memories. _Because it's wrong? Because I'm not real? Or because..._ Her hand moved lower, ghosting across his abdomen. _...because you're afraid you might enjoy it?_

"This isn't—you can't—"

_I already am._ Her voice was steel wrapped in honey. _And you're not stopping me. Zara ran. She saw the monster and fled. But me?_

Her hand touched him through the towel, and the sensation was real enough to make him gasp—fingers wrapping around his cock with confident pressure.

_I want the monster. I've always wanted the monster. That's why I'm here, isn't it? The part of you that embraces what you are. The part that doesn't apologize for the violence, the power, the hunger._

"No." But his body was betraying him, responding to sensations his brain knew couldn't be real but his nervous system registered as undeniable.

_Yes._ She tugged the towel away, and he didn't stop her. Couldn't stop her. "Look at you. Still hard. Still wanting. Your body knows what your mind won't admit.*

She pressed against him, and he felt it all—breasts against his chest, hands on his skin, lips near his throat. His virus-modified neurons firing in patterns that created sensation without actual physical contact. A violation of his own nervous system by something that lived in his enhanced brain.

_Zara wanted you to lose control,_ Evilisa murmured against his ear—or the neural simulation of it. _But she got scared when you did. I'm not scared. I never will be._

"This is wrong." His voice was weak, and he hated himself for it.

_This is honest._ Her hand moved on his cock—stroking, squeezing, the pressure and rhythm impossible to ignore. _This is the truth you hide from everyone else. That you like the power. That you like the violence. That some part of you wants to stop holding back._

"I could have killed her."

_But you didn't. You stopped yourself. Just like you always do._ Her strokes became firmer, more insistent. _But with me? You don't have to stop. I can't be hurt. Can't be broken. Can't leave you._

The sensation was overwhelming—his body responding to nerve signals that had no external source, his mind fragmenting between horror and arousal. She was using his own enhanced neurology against him, creating pleasure from nothing but electrical impulses.

_I'm the only one who can handle all of you. The careful protector AND the beautiful monster._

She dropped to her knees—or created the sensation of dropping—and then her mouth was on him. The feeling was impossible, perfect, wrong. Hot and wet and—

"Stop," he gasped, but his hands were in her hair—her phantom hair that his nervous system insisted was real. "Please."

_You don't want me to stop._ Her voice was muffled, distant. _You want to let go. To stop thinking. To just feel. That's what you wanted with her, isn't it? But you couldn't. You were too afraid._

She was right. God help him, she was right.

_But I'm not her. I'm not anyone. I'm just you. The part that wants. The part that doesn't apologize._ She took him deeper—or made him feel like she did—and his control shattered.

"Fuck."

_Yes. Give in. Let the monster out. For me. Only for me._

His hands tightened in her hair—in the neural sensation of hair—pulling her closer. Wrong. This was wrong. Violated by his own hallucination, his own damaged psyche made manifest. But his body didn't care about wrong. His virus-hijacked nervous system only knew the sensations she was creating.

_That's it. Stop fighting. Stop holding back. With me, you don't have to be careful._

She pulled off him suddenly, the sensation vanishing and leaving him aching. Before he could process the loss, she was standing, turning, pressing her phantom body against the shower wall in an echo of Zara's position moments before.

_Take me. Use me. Let the monster out completely. I can handle it. I want it._

"No." But he was moving toward her anyway, his body overriding his mind's protests.

_Yes. Show me what you couldn't show her. Show me what you really are without limits, without fear, without humanity getting in the way._

His hands found her hips—felt like flesh under his palms despite knowing it was neurological manipulation. His mind screamed that this was violation, manipulation, wrong. But his body was already moving, already—

_Perfect. My beautiful, terrible boy. My monster._

When he entered her—when his virus-modified nervous system created the sensation of entering her—it felt real enough to destroy him. Tight and hot and welcoming. He thrust hard, harder than he'd dared with Zara, and she made sounds of pleasure that his damaged mind created and his ears processed as real.

_More. Harder. You won't break me. You can't._

His hands tightened on her hips, fingers digging in with enhanced strength. If she were real, he'd be leaving bruises. Causing pain. But she wasn't real, so he could—

_Let it all out. Every bit of control you've been holding. Every bit of violence you keep locked away. Give it to me._

He did.

His hips snapped forward brutally, his hands gripped with strength that would shatter real bones. He used her with the full force of his enhancements, holding nothing back, and she loved it—or made him think she did. Her moans of pleasure were rewards, validation, proof that someone could handle what he was.

_Yes! This! This is what I wanted to see! The monster unleashed!_

He felt his control dissolving completely—not the partial loss with Zara, but total abandonment. The predator taking over. The killer. The thing that shouldn't exist in human skin. His hands moved to her throat—phantom throat—and squeezed.

_Yes! Choke me! Hurt me! I'm not scared!_

And he did. He squeezed with strength that would collapse a windpipe, crush vertebrae, kill. But she wasn't real, so he could do anything. Be anything. The monster without consequences.

_Beautiful. You're beautiful like this. Honest. True._

His climax built with terrifying intensity—not just physical but something deeper, darker. A release of everything he kept chained. His hand tightened on her throat, his hips driving forward with inhuman force, and when he came it was with a roar that was more animal than human.

_Yes! Mine! My monster! My beautiful, terrible monster!_

The pleasure was so intense it bordered on agony—every nerve firing, his virus-enhanced body shuddering with sensations that were half-real and half-hallucination. He felt her phantom body convulse around him, heard her screaming her satisfaction, and some broken part of him gloried in it.

When it ended, he found himself on the bathroom floor, gasping, his hand pressed against the cool tile where her throat had been. Alone. Had always been alone.

But the sensations had been real. The pleasure had been real. The loss of control had been real.

And that was the horror of it.

_See?_ Her voice was soft now, satisfied. _That's what you really are. That's what I bring out. And wasn't it perfect?_

He stared at his hand—the one that had crushed her phantom throat with strength that would have killed a real person. The one that had released the monster completely, without restraint, without mercy.

"What have I done?"

_Nothing. Everything. You let yourself be real._ She materialized beside him, her form solid-seeming in his post-climax clarity. _You let the monster out. And I'm the only one who will never run from it. The only one who wants it._

"This isn't real. You're not real."

_My touch felt real. Your pleasure was real. Your loss of control was real._ She smiled, and it was the most terrifying expression he'd ever seen. _I'm the only one you'll ever be able to truly let go with. The only one you can use without destroying. The only one who wants to be used._

She leaned close, her phantom lips near his ear.

_I'm the only one who loves your monster. And now that I've tasted it... now that you've let it out... we both know you'll come back for more._

"No."

_Yes. Because everyone else will always leave. Zara left. Isa left. Sedh will leave eventually. Marcus will die. Riley's already dead._ Her voice was gentle, almost tender. _But I'm forever. I'm the constant. And now I'm the only one who knows the truth—that you like being the monster. That you like not having to hold back._

"That's not—"

_Shhh._ Her phantom finger pressed against his lips. _Don't lie to yourself. Not anymore. Not after that._

She faded slowly, her presence dissipating like smoke, leaving only her final whisper hanging in the air:

_Just us, my beautiful monster. Just us forever._

Kyr4n sat on the cold bathroom floor, alone with the horror of what had just happened. Alone with the knowledge that some part of him had enjoyed it. That some broken piece of his psyche had wanted exactly that—to let the monster out without consequences, to stop holding back, to be understood by something that could never be hurt by what he was.

And the worst part, the truly damning part, was knowing she was right.

He would come back.

Because she was the only place the monster could be free.

## Scene Notes

**This scene reveals:**

- Evilisa can manipulate Kyr4n's virus-enhanced nervous system to create real physical sensations
- She's not just a voice but an active predator exploiting his vulnerability
- She deliberately wants to release his "monster" nature completely
- She uses his isolation and trauma to violate his autonomy
- He succumbs despite knowing it's wrong due to vulnerability and neurological manipulation
- This creates a deeply toxic cycle—she's the only "place" he can lose control completely
- The violation is psychological, neurological, and deeply traumatic
- She's positioned herself as his only "safe" outlet for violence/loss of control

**Why this is horrifying:**

- It's assault by his own hallucination/nervous system
- She exploited his vulnerable state after Zara's departure
- She used his fear of hurting real people against him
- She created a false "solution" to his control issues
- She's reinforcing his isolation by being the only one who "accepts" his monster
- This is deeply unhealthy coping mechanism made worse

**Thematic implications:**

- Shows true depth of his psychological damage
- Demonstrates Evilisa as active threat, not just commentary
- Explores the horror of enhanced abilities turned inward
- Questions of consent when manipulated by your own mind
- The trap of toxic coping mechanisms that feel good

**Canon Status:**

- MAY be kept as secret scene outside main novel
- Shows darkest aspect of their dynamic
- May be too intense for main narrative
- Could be referenced obliquely in main text without showing details
- Demonstrates why Evilisa needs resolution—she's actively harmful
