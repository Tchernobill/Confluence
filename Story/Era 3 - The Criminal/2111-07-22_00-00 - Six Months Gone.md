# Six Months Gone

## 📋 Scene Overview

**One-Line Summary:** Six months after Isa's departure, Kyr4n exists as a depressed recluse in Phoenix Recovery's back workshop, avoiding human contact while Sedh and Mira run the business and Riley provides the only remaining brightness.

**Scene Purpose:**

- Plot: Establish Tome 3's starting point; show Phoenix Recovery functioning despite Kyr4n's withdrawal
- Character: Demonstrate depth of Kyr4n's depression and isolation; show how he's changed from Tome 1's hopeful craftsman
- Theme: Explore wasting potential through avoidance; demonstrate how trauma drives isolation
- World: Show business operating with AI management; establish gap between front shop and back workshop

**Scene Stakes:** Will Kyr4n remain trapped in this depressed state, or is there a catalyst coming that will force change (even if that change is destructive)?

---

## 🔗 Narrative Context

### What Came Before (Previous Scene Connections)

- **From [[2.12.012 - The Choice]]:** Kyr4n made decision not to flee when threatened, choosing to fight instead—but this scene shows that decision hasn't translated into action yet
- **From [[2.12.009 - Departure]]:** Isa left six months ago; Riley promised to check on him regularly
- **Unresolved Tension:** How long can Kyr4n survive in this isolated state? What will break the pattern?
- **Character State:** Kyr4n - deeply depressed, avoiding all meaningful human contact except Riley; Sedh - worried but unable to reach him; Mira - pragmatically accepting his isolation; Riley - visiting regularly, trying to help

### What This Scene Accomplishes

1. **Plot Development:** Establishes Tome 3's starting conditions; shows Phoenix Recovery operating despite owner's withdrawal
2. **Character Growth:** Shows Kyr4n has retreated completely from the person he was becoming in Tome 1
3. **Information Revealed:** Six months have passed; business continues; Riley is only human connection; depression is profound
4. **Emotional Journey:** From numb routine → brief spark with Riley → return to hollow isolation

### What This Sets Up (Future Scene Connections)

- **For [[3.01.002 - The First Glimpse]]:** First Evil Isa manifestation will occur when Kyr4n is alone late at night
- **For [[3.03 - The Return]]:** Frank's return will shatter this isolated routine
- **For [[Criminal Arc]]:** This depression and isolation creates vulnerability to the rush that violence will provide
- **Foreshadowing:** Obsessive work as avoidance; electromagnetic abilities constantly active; potential wasting away
- **Promises to Reader:** This static state cannot last; something must break the pattern

## 🎭 Scene Dynamics

### Point of View Notes

**POV Character:** [[03.Hobbies/Writing/Confluence_bak/Characters/Kyr4n]] **POV Limitations:** Cannot see how others perceive him; trapped in internal depression; minimizes own deterioration **Bias/Perspective:** Everything filtered through depressive lens; work as only meaningful reality; relationships feel distant and unreal **Internal Conflict:** Wanting connection vs. fear of proximity; knowing he should engage vs. inability to care; technical competence vs. emotional emptiness

### Character Objectives & Obstacles

**[[03.Hobbies/Writing/Confluence_bak/Characters/Kyr4n]]:**

- Want: To be left alone; to lose himself in technical work
- Need: Human connection; to process grief and trauma; to find purpose beyond avoidance
- Obstacle: Depression making connection feel impossible; trauma from Isa/virus making intimacy terrifying; work providing false sense of function
- Tactics: Staying in back workshop; obsessive project focus; minimal interaction; mechanical politeness when forced to engage

**[[03.Hobbies/Writing/Confluence/Archives/Old Characters/Sedh/Sedh]]:**

- Want: To reach Kyr4n emotionally; to help creator heal
- Need: To accept limitations of intervention
- Obstacle: Kyr4n's walls; AI inability to truly understand human depression
- Tactics: Gentle questions; managing business to remove pressure; giving space while watching closely

**[[03.Hobbies/Writing/Confluence_bak/Characters/Riley]]:**

- Want: To remind Kyr4n there's still good in the world
- Need: To not give up on his friend
- Obstacle: Kyr4n's numbness; limited time (courier work); feeling helpless
- Tactics: Regular visits; casual conversation; not pushing too hard; being consistently present

**[[Customer]]:**

- Want: Device repaired
- Need: To feel safe in Phoenix Recovery despite owner's withdrawn state
- Obstacle: Kyr4n's off-putting demeanor

### Relationship Dynamics in This Scene

- **Kyr4n/Sedh:** Parent/child roles reversed—Sedh managing operations, trying to care for creator
- **Kyr4n/Riley:** Only relationship where Kyr4n shows any warmth; Riley as tether to humanity
- **Kyr4n/Mira:** Professional partnership; Mira pragmatically accepting his state
- **Power Balance:** Sedh and Mira have operational control; Kyr4n has withdrawn from leadership
- **Subtext:** "I'm fine" means "I'm drowning" / "Let me help" means "I'm scared for you" / Riley's presence means "You still matter"

## 📖 Scene Structure

### Opening Beat

**Anchor:** Late afternoon, Phoenix Recovery back workshop, six months after Isa's departure **Hook:** Kyr4n alone among increasingly complex projects, electromagnetic senses constantly active picking up the shop's electrical signatures **Mood/Atmosphere:** Suffocating stillness; technical brilliance wasted on busywork; the hollow echo of a space that should be full but isn't

### Key Story Beats (in sequence)

1. **Isolation Established:** Kyr4n working on sophisticated device, aware of customer interaction in front shop via electromagnetic senses, choosing to stay hidden
2. **Business Operating:** Sedh handling customer professionally while Kyr4n avoids; Mira managing technical consultations
3. **Forced Interaction:** Customer insists on speaking to "the expert"; Kyr4n emerges from back room
4. **Withdrawn Performance:** Kyr4n technically competent but emotionally absent; customer uncomfortable with his demeanor
5. **Sedh's Gentle Concern:** After customer leaves, Sedh tries to reach him with questions about self-care, eating, leaving the workshop
6. **Deflection:** Kyr4n dismisses concerns, claims he's "fine," retreats to back room
7. **Riley's Visit:** Only moment of genuine warmth; brief conversation showing Riley's concern and Kyr4n's slight responsiveness
8. **Riley's Departure:** Brightness leaves; Kyr4n returns to hollow routine
9. **Closing Isolation:** Alone again with projects and electromagnetic awareness; sense of wasting away

### Closing Beat

**Changed State:** Brief spark with Riley's visit has faded; Kyr4n back to numb isolation **Hook/Question:** How long can this continue? What will it take to break this pattern? **Emotional Note:** Hollow resignation; potential wasting away; the quiet tragedy of someone brilliant choosing emptiness

## 🌐 World & Setting Details

### Physical Environment

**Location Details:** Phoenix Recovery workshop divided into front (customer-facing, managed by Sedh/Mira) and back (Kyr4n's isolated workspace with increasingly complex projects scattered everywhere) **Atmosphere:** Front shop - professional, busy, functional; Back workshop - cluttered, dim, electromagnetic hum constant, smell of solder and ozone, no natural light **Objects of Significance:** Sophisticated electromagnetic device Kyr4n is building (purpose unclear); tools Isa once touched (avoided); empty space where her workstation was; Riley's preferred chair (only clean spot)

### World-Building Elements Introduced

- **Technology:** Electromagnetic sensing constantly active; advanced projects showing Kyr4n's growing technical skill despite depression
- **Social Dynamics:** AI-managed business succeeding; human owner's withdrawal not stopping operations
- **History:** Six months since separation; Phoenix Recovery adapted to new reality
- **Rules of World:** Enhanced individuals can function technically while emotionally destroyed; AIs can manage human business independently

---

## 💭 Themes & Symbolism

### Thematic Exploration

**Primary Theme:** Wasting Potential - brilliant craftsman reduced to avoiding life through busywork **How It's Explored:** Through contrast between technical competence and emotional emptiness; successful business vs. owner's withdrawal; potential for connection (Riley) vs. choice of isolation

**Secondary Themes:**

- Isolation as self-protection that becomes prison
- Work as avoidance mechanism
- AI family trying to care for damaged creator
- Depression as persistent state vs. acute crisis

### Symbolic Elements

- **Back workshop vs. front shop:** Division between engagement and withdrawal
- **Electromagnetic awareness:** Ability to sense everything while choosing to engage with nothing
- **Complex projects:** Technical brilliance wasted on meaningless busywork
- **Riley's chair:** Island of human warmth in sea of isolation
- **Empty spaces:** Where Isa used to be; absences more present than presences

### Philosophical Questions Raised

- Can technical competence mask emotional destruction indefinitely?
- Is isolation self-protection or self-destruction?
- What constitutes "functioning" when you're hollow inside?
- How do we help someone who doesn't want help?

## 📝 Craft Notes

### Voice & Style Targets

**Pacing:** Slow, weighted - reflecting depression's drag on time **Sentence Rhythm:** Longer descriptive passages broken by short, mechanical dialogue; mimicking Kyr4n's internal numbness **POV Distance:** Close - deep in Kyr4n's depressive perspective but aware enough to see his own deterioration **Dialogue Balance:** Minimal dialogue; much unsaid; Riley section slightly more dialogue to show contrast

### Sensory Emphasis

**Primary Sense:** Electromagnetic awareness as constant background sensation; replacing emotional awareness **Mood Through Senses:** Ozone smell, mechanical hum, dim light creating oppressive atmosphere; Riley's presence brightening both literal and emotional atmosphere

### Show vs Tell Balance

**Show:** Depression through actions (avoiding people, obsessive work, mechanical responses), environmental details (cluttered workshop, avoided spaces), electromagnetic sensing instead of looking **Tell:** Time passed (six months), business operations, Riley's visit schedule - efficient context delivery

## 📚 LLM Prompting Summary

> **For LLM: Here's the concise version for generating draft text:**

**Scene Context:** Six months after Isa's departure following viral crisis in Tome 2. Kyr4n has retreated to Phoenix Recovery's back workshop, living as depressed recluse while Sedh and Mira manage business operations. Riley visits regularly as only remaining human connection. This is Tome 3's opening scene, establishing the status quo before Frank's return shatters it.

**Scene Goal:** Establish Kyr4n's profound depression and isolation while showing Phoenix Recovery continuing to function; demonstrate how far he's fallen from Tome 1's hopeful craftsman; introduce electromagnetic abilities as constant background awareness; show Riley as only bright spot.

**Characters Present:**

- [[03.Hobbies/Writing/Confluence_bak/Characters/Kyr4n]]: Age 29, deeply depressed, avoiding all human contact except Riley, technically competent but emotionally hollow, electromagnetic senses constantly active, working obsessively on complex projects as avoidance
- [[03.Hobbies/Writing/Confluence/Archives/Old Characters/Sedh/Sedh]]: Worried about creator, managing front shop, trying gently to reach Kyr4n emotionally, failing
- [[03.Hobbies/Writing/Confluence_bak/Characters/Mira]]: Pragmatically accepting Kyr4n's isolation, handling technical consultations, medical monitoring
- [[03.Hobbies/Writing/Confluence_bak/Characters/Riley]]: Visiting regularly per promise to Isa, only person who gets genuine warmth from Kyr4n, concerned but not pushy
- [[Customer]]: Generic repair customer, uncomfortable with Kyr4n's withdrawn demeanor

**Key Beats:**

1. Opening in back workshop - Kyr4n alone with complex projects, electromagnetic awareness of front shop activity
2. Customer interaction in front shop (heard/sensed electromagnetically) - Sedh handling professionally
3. Customer insists on expert - Kyr4n forced to emerge
4. Brief interaction showing technical competence but emotional absence
5. Customer leaves uncomfortable; Sedh's gentle concern attempt
6. Kyr4n deflects, retreats to back room
7. Riley arrives - only moment of warmth and genuine connection
8. Casual conversation showing Riley's concern, Kyr4n's slight responsiveness
9. Riley leaves; brightness fades
10. Kyr4n alone again in hollow routine

**Tone:** Suffocating depression; quiet isolation; wasting potential; brief spark with Riley then back to emptiness; heavy but not melodramatic

**Critical Details to Include:**

- Six months explicitly stated as time passed
- Electromagnetic sensing as constant background awareness (sensing shop activity, electrical signatures)
- Back workshop vs. front shop spatial division
- Sedh/Mira running operations successfully
- Kyr4n's technical projects increasingly sophisticated but purposeless
- Empty spaces where Isa used to be (avoided)
- Riley's chair/preferred spot (only clean area)
- Contrast between technical competence and emotional numbness
- Brief warmth with Riley vs. surrounding isolation

**Must Avoid:**

- Overwrought depression prose - keep it grounded
- Making Kyr4n completely non-functional
- Explaining electromagnetic abilities - just use them naturally
- Making Riley section tonally jarring
- Losing Kyr4n's dry humor completely
- Over-explaining the separation or past events
- Making scene static without forward momentum hint

**Stylistic Notes:**

- Use electromagnetic sensing for environmental awareness instead of looking/hearing
- Longer descriptive passages for oppressive atmosphere
- Short, mechanical dialogue for most interactions
- Slightly more flowing dialogue with Riley
- Show time passage through environmental details (dust, seasons visible through window if any, project progression)
- Depression through behavior and environment, not just thoughts
