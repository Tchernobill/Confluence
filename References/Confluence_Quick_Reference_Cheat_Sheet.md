**Knows:** Character currently knows: ________________
**Feels:** Character emotional state: ________________

## âœï¸ WHILE WRITING

### Voice Check Questions

### Quick Continuity Checks
**Physical**: Does description match Character Bible?

**Timeline**: How much time has passed?

### Instant Flags
When uncertain, type:
- `[CHECK: detail to verify]`

- `[CONTINUITY: potential issue]`

Search these later to catch everything.

**These skills exist to FREE your creativity, not constrain it.**

They handle the mechanical consistency work so you can focus on:
- Crafting compelling scenes
- Developing complex characters  
- Creating emotional resonance
- Building thematic depth

**The 10 minutes before/after each chapter prevents hours of revision headaches.**

**The system works when it becomes invisible** - just part of how you write.
