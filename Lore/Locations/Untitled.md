# Unified Geography of Confluence

## Overall Geographical Context

In the year 2087, the **Corporate Collective** enacted the "Efficience Protocol," a sweeping urban reorganization presented as an environmental reform initiative. Officially, it aimed to consolidate populations near resource extraction zones for sustainability. In reality, it optimized for automation and the digital economy: rare earth mining in the southern plains required human labor, while the island's infrastructure suited high-tech operations. Over five years, 2.8 million residents were forcibly relocated from Montreal Island to makeshift settlements on the South Shore. Only 150,000 "essential personnel"—executives, scientists, engineers, and support staff—remained on the island, now fortified as **The Citadel**.

The region spans the former Greater Montreal area, divided by **The Great River** (Saint Lawrence River), which acts as a natural and fortified barrier. To the north lies The Citadel (Montreal Island), a gleaming arcology of glass, steel, and advanced defenses, nicknamed "The Crown." South of the river is **The South Shore**, an industrial wasteland of mining pits, toxic dumps, and dense settlements, pejoratively called "The South Shore Slums" or "The Sprawl" by Citadel elites. The South Shore covers approximately 720 km², supporting 1.5 million inhabitants through survival economies tied to mining, salvage, and black-market trade.

Key geographical features include:
- **Bodies of Water**: The Great River (primary divide), Rich Flow (Richelieu River, southern route), Prairie Stream (Rivière des Prairies, northern boundary), Saint Louis Lake (Lac Saint-Louis, western), and Prairie Basin (Bassin de Laprairie, southern collection).
- **Terrain**: The Crown (Mont-Royal, fortified peak); The Heights (Monteregian Hills, mining zones); The Flats (Saint Lawrence Lowlands, industrial); The Divide (Richelieu Valley, southern boundary).
- **Transportation**: Bridges like JeeCee Portal (Jacques Cartier, primary checkpoint), Champion Bridge (Champlain, military), Victory Bridge (Victoria, rail), Mercer Span (Mercier, industrial), and The LaFont Tube (Louis-Hippolyte-Lafontaine Tunnel, cargo). Road networks include The Ten (Autoroute 10, eastern mining), The Fifteen (Autoroute 15, supply), The Twenty (Autoroute 20, freight), The Thirty (Autoroute 30, smuggling), and The Forty (Autoroute 40, cross-island). Underground transit: The Underpass (Yellow Metro, secret crossing), with other lines for Citadel internal use.
- **Airports**: PET Terminal/Elliott Field (Pierre Elliott Trudeau, corporate); Saint-Hub Strips (Saint-Hubert, cargo/smuggling).
- **Environmental Divide**: The Citadel enjoys climate control and protection from brutal winters (-30°C, ice storms, acid snow). The South Shore suffers toxic fog, contaminated waters, unstable ground, and seasonal isolation, with geothermal vents from mining providing sporadic warmth.
- **Economic and Social Dynamics**: The Citadel exports tech and pharma; the South Shore provides rare earths and labor. Smuggling occurs via The Underpass and hidden tunnels. Information warfare pits Citadel propaganda (PropNet) against South Shore pirate networks (The Mesh).

Total population: ~1.65 million (Citadel: 150,000; South Shore: 1.5 million).

## The South Shore

**Population**: 1.5 million  
**Nickname**: "The Sprawl" (pejorative "South Shore Slums" used by Citadel residents)  
**Language**: Franglais Patois (street dialect)  
**Society**: Survival-based, with tribal loyalties, mining guilds, tech runners, crime syndicates ("The Family"), and environmental activists ("Cleaners"). Technology is jury-rigged, with crude biomods, cybernetics, and decentralized networks resilient to cold. Winters bring "Heat Wars" over geothermal resources.

The South Shore is politically fragmented into seven territories, each embodying a socio-economic archetype with natural frictions (e.g., labor vs. reform, smuggling vs. militarization). Territories are based on former municipalities, governed by gangs, councils, or consortia. Each centers on a main habitation cluster: giant assemblies of shipping containers forming "Stacks." The core Stack is high-density (15-20 units high, ~45-60 meters), housing families in interlocked units with external conduits for utilities. Density decreases outward, blending into scattered outposts. Blocks are arranged in grids or defensive formations, with vertical hierarchies (top: leaders with views/gardens; mid: skilled workers; bottom: laborers, prone to flooding/crime).

**Territory Borders Overview** (based on real-world geography, from north-central outward):
- Phoenix Rising (central) borders: Northside Collective (north), Riverside Sovereignty (east along river), Stacks Federation (scattered enclaves within/around).

- Stacks Federation (scattered suburbs) borders: All others via enclaves, especially Phoenix Rising (central) and Mining Consortium (south).
- Border March (outskirts) borders: All inner territories, forming a militarized buffer against Citadel (north) and wastelands (south/east/west).
