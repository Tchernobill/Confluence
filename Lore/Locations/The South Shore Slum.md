# The South Shore Slum: A Regional Guide
*Visual Description and Geographic Distribution*

---

## Overview

The South Shore Slum sprawls across what was once the prosperous suburban communities south of Montreal, now transformed into a dystopian mega-settlement housing over 3.2 million souls. Stretching from the polluted banks of the St. Lawrence River to the toxic mining territories near the US border, this vast industrial wasteland represents one of North America's largest unincorporated urban zones.

The landscape is dominated by **The Stacks** - massive residential towers built from shipping containers - rising like brutal monuments against the gray sky. These towering structures, interspersed with industrial complexes, scrapyards, and underground markets, create a hellish urban canyon that stretches to the horizon.

## The Stacks: Container Cities

### Architecture and Construction

The Stacks represent desperate ingenuity on a massive scale. Each individual **block** consists of shipping containers arranged in a grid: 2 containers wide, 60 containers long, and 15 levels high. These structures rise 39 meters into the air - nearly 13 stories - creating imposing walls of corrugated steel that stretch for almost 400 meters in length.

The containers are interlocked like massive Lego blocks, with alternating orientations providing structural stability. Internal steel reinforcement at the 4-meter mark (roughly half-height) prevents buckling, while external guy-wires and welded frameworks provide additional support. Each container houses a single family unit, with basic electrical and plumbing jury-rigged through external conduits that snake up the sides of the blocks like mechanical vines.

**Visual Impact**: From a distance, the Stacks appear as colossal industrial barracks, their surfaces streaked with rust stains and improvised modifications. Windows have been cut into container walls, creating irregular patterns of light. Smoke rises from countless barrel fires, especially during the brutal winter months when residents burn scavenged materials for warmth.

### Population Distribution

**Total Stack Population**: 1.3 million residents housed in 206 blocks
**Average Family Size**: 3.5 people per container unit
**Total Housing Units**: 371,000 container homes

## Major Stack Complexes

### Longueuil Central Stack
**Location**: Former downtown Longueuil  
**Size**: 30 blocks arranged in a 5×6 grid  
**Population**: ~190,000 residents  
**Height**: Creates an urban canyon 2 kilometers long, 1 kilometer wide

The largest and most infamous of the Stack complexes, Longueuil Central dominates the skyline like a massive fortress. The blocks are arranged in parallel rows with narrow service alleys between them, creating a labyrinthine urban environment where sunlight rarely reaches ground level. External staircases and improvised bridges connect the blocks at various levels, forming a three-dimensional city within the city.

**Key Features**:
- Central courtyard with underground market access
- Rooftop gardens and communication arrays
- Multiple gang territories with clear boundary markings
- The infamous "Stack Exchange" - a vertical trading post spanning multiple levels

### Brossard Industrial Stack
**Location**: Former Brossard commercial district  
**Size**: 25 blocks in distributed clusters  
**Population**: ~160,000 residents  

Built around existing industrial infrastructure, this complex integrates the container blocks with factory buildings and warehouse structures. The Stacks here serve dual purposes - housing above, light manufacturing and workshops below. Steam and smoke from industrial operations create a perpetual haze over the area.

**Visual Characteristics**:
- Containers mounted on concrete foundations and steel frameworks
- Integration with existing industrial buildings
- Heavy power line networks creating dangerous electrical tangles
- Constant background noise from manufacturing operations

### Saint-Hubert Transport Hub
**Location**: Former Saint-Hubert airport and surrounding area  
**Size**: 20 blocks arranged along transport corridors  
**Population**: ~125,000 residents  

The most strategically located Stack complex, positioned to control access to the mining territories and trade routes. The blocks are arranged in linear formations along major transport arteries, creating "container highways" that funnel traffic through controlled checkpoints.

**Notable Features**:
- Blocks positioned to overlook all major roadways
- Integrated security towers and observation posts
- Heavy vehicle traffic creating constant dust clouds
- The famous "Airstrip Market" built on the old runway

### Greenfield Waste Stack
**Location**: Former Greenfield Park, now toxic dumping grounds  
**Size**: 15 blocks in defensive formation  
**Population**: ~95,000 residents  

The most dangerous and polluted of the major complexes, built directly on contaminated soil. The air glows faintly green at night from chemical reactions in the waste below. Residents here are typically the most desperate or those involved in hazardous waste processing industries.

**Environmental Impact**:
- Sickly green luminescence visible from orbit
- Constant chemical smell and toxic fog
- Higher rates of mutation and illness
- Specialized medical facilities for radiation treatment

## Medium Stack Clusters

### Neighborhood Stacks (10-15 locations)
**Size**: 5-10 blocks each  
**Population**: 35,000-70,000 per cluster  

These medium-sized complexes are scattered throughout former suburban communities like Boucherville, Chambly, and Varennes. Each cluster typically grows around a specific resource or trade advantage - proximity to salvage yards, access to clean water, defensible positions, or transport links.

**Typical Configuration**:
- Blocks arranged in defensive squares or L-shapes
- Central courtyards for community gatherings and markets
- Specialized facilities (medical, technical, educational)
- Clear territorial boundaries marked by gang symbols

### Border Outposts
**Location**: Along the Citadel perimeter and mining territories  
**Purpose**: Control points and forward bases  

These smaller Stack clusters serve as watchtowers and border controls, their height advantage providing surveillance over surrounding areas. Many house smugglers, border guards, and those who profit from traffic between territories.

---

## Small Settlement Stacks

### Rural Outposts (20+ locations)
**Size**: 2-5 blocks each  
**Population**: 15,000-35,000 per settlement  

Scattered throughout the vast territory, these small Stack settlements serve as:
- Mining operation support bases
- Agricultural processing centers
- Scavenge operation headquarters
- Defensive outposts against raiders from the wasteland

**Survival Focus**: These communities are typically more self-sufficient, with rooftop gardens, water collection systems, and integrated workshops for essential maintenance.

## The Landscape Between

### Industrial Zones
Between the major Stack complexes, the landscape is dominated by:
- **Scrapyards**: Mountains of twisted metal and electronic waste
- **Processing Plants**: Chemical refineries and waste treatment facilities
- **Transport Corridors**: Highways lined with fuel depots and repair stations
- **Underground Networks**: Tunnel systems connecting basements and sewer lines

### Environmental Conditions
The South Shore presents a hostile environment shaped by industrial contamination:
- **Acid Rain**: Corrodes exposed metal, requiring constant maintenance
- **Toxic Fog**: Chemical haze that reduces visibility and burns lungs
- **Contaminated Waterways**: Rivers that glow with industrial runoff
- **Unstable Ground**: Areas where chemical dumping has weakened soil structure

### Winter Survival
During the brutal Canadian winters, the Stacks become survival challenges:
- **Ice Formation**: Entire blocks can become encased in ice from frozen plumbing leaks
- **Heating Crisis**: Residents burn anything combustible, creating dangerous fire hazards
- **Structural Stress**: Weight of ice and snow causes regular collapses
- **Isolation**: Storms can cut off entire complexes for days or weeks

## Vertical Society

### Level-Based Hierarchy
Within each Stack block, social status correlates with vertical position:

**Top Levels (12-15)**: 
- Gang leaders and successful entrepreneurs
- Best views and easiest escape routes
- Rooftop gardens and communication equipment
- Penthouse containers with luxury modifications

**Mid Levels (6-11)**:
- Skilled workers and small business owners
- Stable employment and moderate security
- Access to communal facilities and social networks
- Family units with children

**Lower Levels (1-5)**:
- Unskilled laborers and recent arrivals
- Highest crime rates and structural dangers
- Flooding and waste disposal issues
- Temporary housing and transient population

### Inter-Stack Politics
The major Stack complexes operate as city-states, each with:
- **Governing Councils**: Usually dominated by gang leaders
- **Economic Specialization**: Each complex focusing on specific industries
- **Military Capability**: Armed forces for defense and territorial expansion
- **Diplomatic Relations**: Alliances and conflicts with neighboring Stacks

## Daily Life in the Stacks

### Morning Routine
Dawn breaks gray and smoky over the container city. Residents emerge onto external staircases and catwalks, beginning their vertical commute to ground level. The sound of thousands of footsteps on metal grating creates a constant percussion rhythm. Smoke from cooking fires and heating barrels creates a haze that obscures the upper levels.

### Market Activity
Ground level between the blocks transforms into massive open-air markets. Vendors set up stalls in the shadows of the towering containers, selling everything from salvaged electronics to homemade alcohol. The narrow alleys echo with dozens of languages and the constant sound of haggling.

### Evening Atmosphere
As darkness falls, the Stacks come alive with artificial light. Each level glows with the warm light of jury-rigged electrical systems, creating a pattern like illuminated honeycombs. Music drifts from various levels - some containers converted to bars, others to underground radio stations broadcasting to the entire Slum.

### Community Bonds
Despite the harsh conditions, strong communities form within each block. Neighbors share resources, watch each other's children, and maintain informal security networks. These bonds often prove stronger than blood family, forged in the crucible of shared survival.

## The View from Above

From the observation decks of the Montreal Citadel, the South Shore Slum presents a terrifying spectacle. The massive Stacks stretch to the horizon like industrial mountain ranges, their surfaces gleaming dully in the perpetual haze. At night, they become constellations of lights - each point representing a family struggling to survive in this post-apocalyptic landscape.

The contrast is intentional and absolute: the gleaming towers of the Citadel versus the brutal functionality of the Stacks. One represents corporate perfection, the other human resilience in the face of abandonment. Together, they define the visual landscape of Neo-Montreal's divided world.

The Stacks stand as monuments to both corporate callousness and human ingenuity - proof that even in the darkest cyberpunk future, communities find ways to survive, adapt, and maintain their humanity in the face of overwhelming odds.
