# OPERATION STONEBONE
## Tactical Brief - Shore Liberation Front

**Classification**: ABSOLUTE BLACK  
**Operation Code**: StoneBone  
**Primary Operator**: Vyr4n  
**Mission Date**: [REDACTED]  
**Authorization**: Emergency Response to Crown Nuclear Threat

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Operation StoneBone represents a kinetic response to imminent Citadel tactical nuclear deployment against Shore civilian populations. Primary objective: demonstrate Shore capability to strike Crown executive infrastructure, forcing reconsideration of nuclear option through targeted psychological warfare.

**Bottom Line**: 300 concrete-filled oxygen tanks launched simultaneously will overwhelm Crown Defense Grid and deliver precision strikes against corporate command structures.

"Because medieval sieges physics just dont care about technological superiority."

## EXPECTED OUTCOMES

- **Observatory sensor network destruction** (Wave 4)
- **Access point breach capability** (Wave 5)

**Strategic Vulnerability**:
- **Citadel rendered defenseless** against conventional attack
- **Command structure exposed** to final demonstration (Wave 6)
- **Nuclear deployment capability preserved** but authority undermined

### Strategic Implications
- **Nuclear authorization delay/cancellation** (primary objective achieved)
- **Corporate Collective vulnerability demonstration** without mass casualties
- **Shore technological capability proof** - systematic defense elimination
- **Citadel workforce preservation** - minimal civilian impact
- **Strategic stalemate establishment** - mutual vulnerability achieved

### Message Delivered
*"Your defenses are neutralized. Your workforce is safe. Your executives are exposed. Reconsider."*

## RISK ASSESSMENT

### Mission Risks
- **Partial intercept**: 14/20 projectiles intercepted (acceptable)
- **Launch detection**: Premature Crown response (mitigated by simultaneous launch)
- **Technical failure**: Multi-stage system complexity (redundancy built-in)

### Strategic Risks
- **Escalation**: Crown response with enhanced nuclear threat
- **Retaliation**: Conventional military response against Shore
- **Civilian casualties**: Unintended impact zones (target selection minimizes)

### Operational Security
- **Shore operator safety**: Underground tunnel extraction routes
- **Equipment disposal**: Launch sites abandoned post-operation
- **Communication security**: Shore-mesh encrypted channels only

---

## CONCLUSION

Operation StoneBone leverages Shore industrial capability against Crown technological assumptions. While sophisticated in engineering, the attack's conceptual simplicity defeats advanced defense systems designed for conventional threats. 

The Citadel expects cyber warfare, stealth infiltration, or coordinated drone swarms. They do not expect twenty supersonic concrete projectiles launched from mining equipment.

**Recommendation**: Execute immediately upon Crown nuclear authorization confirmation.

I'm working on a cyberpunk novel and want to clearly define the defensive capacity of a walled city called the Citadel.

I want them to have capacities like the Israel Iron Dome, but approximatively 100 years into the future. Currently, I'm thinking of:

20 x Automated gun turret like the Phalanx CIWS systems
5 x Interceptor missiles launchers, both guided and autonomous
3 x Swarm drone launchpads
4 x Laser energy beam
Array of multiples sensors including radar, optical, X-band ans more
Centralised defence coordination AI (Called Sammy)
Each defence tower is protected by a Plasma Arc Barriers
- Ionized particle fields that create "lightning fences" between tower nodes
- Vaporizes small projectiles and drones on contact
- Creates blue-white electrical displays 

Capable of tracking 1000 targets simultaniously, engaging 30 drones per seconds at 2km for 72 hours, it should be able to take down anything flying in the sky that is bigger or faster than a pigeon, from compact drone to fleet of aircraft to ICBM.

The attacker need to be able to defeat them with:
300 x standard steel industrial gas tank (200kg, 1.5m length × 0.3m diameter) filled with concrete (800kg).
Accelerated to 220 m/s in a 3 stage operation:
  - launched mechanically to 80m/s
  - electromagnetic acceleration second stage adding 90 m/s
  - 3rd stage internal rocket ignition system adding 50 m/s.
- Pure precise ballistic trajectory.
- No electronical component or guidance system
- No warhead
- Rely only on kinetic energy transfert on impact (should be around 20MJ per projectile
- 5 Launcher platform
- 1 projectile per 5 second capacity.
- Launch distance: 5km from Citadel perimeter
- Launch angle: 45° optimal ballistic trajectory
- Flight time: 32 seconds
- Flight profile: Ballistic arc, subsonic speeds

The AI must be able to detect the first projectile one second after launch, get an initial ballistic report of the threat, and began to engage the target with a mild answer.
Near the end of the engagement, the AI should be able to deviate the initial target slightly off-course, while there is still 50 more currently in flight.

Can you help me define and refine that system, so that it look and feel cyberpunk? Since it is set in the future, you can invent more defence system than those listed.
