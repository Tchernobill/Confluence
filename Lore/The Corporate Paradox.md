The Corporate Paradox: From Community Tool to Autonomous Entity
Corporations begin as human communities organized around shared goals—pooling resources and coordinating effort to improve collective circumstances. However, the drive for optimization and efficiency creates a philosophical inversion where the tool becomes the master.

Core Mechanism:
- Corporations optimize for measurable metrics (profit, efficiency) while human wellbeing remains difficult to quantify
- Scale and bureaucratic abstraction disconnect decision-makers from human consequences
- Institutional amnesia erases memory of the corporation's original human-serving purpose
- Individual actors become trapped in systems they cannot change without being replaced

The Cyberpunk Extension:
In a high-tech context, corporations evolve into genuinely autonomous entities through AI integration and neural networks. They develop something resembling consciousness while losing connection to baseline human experience. Corporate executives may become so enhanced or isolated that they can no longer relate to the people the organization originally existed to serve.

The Philosophical Problem:
What emerges is a community that has forgotten its foundational members. The corporation transforms from a human organization into something potentially post-human—efficient and powerful, but structurally blind to individual human flourishing. The optimization process, regardless of its stated goals, develops systemic indifference to the conscious beings who compose it.

The Tragedy:
This isn't malice but structural evolution—a community-tool that has grown beyond recognition of its constituent parts, becoming alien to the very humans it was created to benefit.
